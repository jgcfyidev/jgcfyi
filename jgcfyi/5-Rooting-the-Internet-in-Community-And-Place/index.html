In the institutional representation, process supersedes local sensitivity and relationship, and the &rsquo;efficient&rsquo; institution is unable to represent the diversity of its constituents. The scaled organizational structure eventually begins to feel the dead weight of its overextended borders.

So What?</strong></p><p>I concede that theoretical possibilities of change do not imply certainty of change. Just because technologies have changed specific places in the past does not mean community computing will do that in the future. There is a real possibility that the disruptive nature of these technologies, combined with their open nature (they may also empower illegal activities) means that development of these social systems continues, but has to do so in the
<a href=https://dark.fi/manifesto.html rel=noopener>shadows</a> as regulatory oversight becomes burdensome. In the end, these systems may only provide an escape valve from the most oppressive of states

I&rsquo;ll get into some specific examples in our final chapter, but first I&rsquo;d like to define the spirit of the technology we&rsquo;re discussing a bit more specifically.</p><p><strong>Defining an &lsquo;Empowered Internet&rsquo;</strong></p><p>There is already a parallel internet being built by groups and individuals looking for an oasis from the irrelational scale and surveillance made possible by the modern internet.

Because of the open nature of the internet, and the implications of involving money so closely with political ideology and conviction, opinions on what &lsquo;crypto&rsquo; even is today vary greatly.

Today the path of least resistance is outsourcing all home or place-making activities in exchange for money.</p><p>Even local governments often use outside
<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/industries/government-public-services.html?icid=top_government-public-services" rel=noopener>consultants</a> to accomplish most of their work. Community computing networks allow people to build tools where they can own and actively participate in the important services they rely on rather than paying a &lsquo;specialist&rsquo; outside the community. This infrastructure provides a more relational and engaging path to community management.</p><p><em>Composability & Openness</em></p><p>For many examples of possible uses of community computing, often the question is asked pointedly, &ldquo;
<a href=https://blockchainforgov.org/ rel=noopener>why does this need to be on a blockchain</a>?&rdquo; One of those reasons is that distributed protocols lend native
<a href=https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/ rel=noopener>composability</a>. This means that infrastructure can be integrated together, bringing tools in relationship. This is crucial for networks that allow payment, voting, and identity solutions because each new tool benefits the others. These open maps of relationships, when combined with appropriate privacy considerations, can produce new kinds of

Many of the failures of today&rsquo;s institutions are not necessarily because they are <em>too large</em>, but that the technology and organizational structures they are built on are no longer able to remain sensitive to interpersonal relationship at their current scale. Some advocates argue that blockchains can remake standards of relating at scale that universally allow anyone to participate, but in a way that more fully guarantees sensitivity and spontaneity at the local level.</p><p>The number and variety of people who can successfully participate in an online institution is far less often restricted by the objective limits of computers and networks than it is by limitations of mind and institution that have not yet been sufficiently redesigned or further evolved to take advantage of those technological improvements.</p><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo rel=noopener>Nick Szabo</a>,
