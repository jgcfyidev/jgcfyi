<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpBOgh2zxtE" rel=noopener>now</a> more semiotically convenient to regard agency as a phenomenon of the individual, a rich and enduring state of individual self-determination is only achieved when communities produce it together, for each other.</p><p>Just as vital to agency as our <em>interpersonal</em> relationships are our relationships with the physical places we make our lives in. These places existed long before our intervention, and will surely outlast us. At the same time they are, inescapably, an accumulation of their collective communal management up until this point. Only by both attuning ourselves to the unique ecology of our specific place and carrying a deep memory of local traditions of placemaking can we cultivate thriving communities sustainably.</p><a href=#agency-and-limits><h2 id=agency-and-limits><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Agency and Limits</h2></a><p>Given our own agency&rsquo;s relationship to people and place over generations, capacity to shape the world does not connote an invitation to limitless consumption, but instead relies on our faculty for
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcvJs6RS2Ek" rel=noopener>affection</a> and the extension of trust in and with our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS3-PffLKqM&t=1100s" rel=noopener>home place</a>.</p><p>As technology broadens our
<a href="https://newdesigncongress.org/en/about#:~:text=now-work-as-,accelerants,-%E2%80%93-exacerbating-social%2C-political" rel=noopener>capacity</a> to consume, the means by which limits are formed has become more an existential than technical question. It is not that natural limits have been transcended, but that our technology allows us to more easily externalize the effects of our consumption. Part of fostering agency in society, then, relies on our capacity to
<a href="https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/mmt/#:~:text=But-a-monetary-sovereign-has-to-conjure-its-own-source-of-discipline." rel=noopener>conjure our own source of discipline</a>. The means by which we foster these limits are the subject of this series of essays.</p><a href=#limits-derived-in-institutions><h3 id=limits-derived-in-institutions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Limits Derived in Institutions</h3></a><p>As the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter#:~:text=as-Roman-agricultural,of-more-territory." rel=noopener>scope</a> of our consumption expands, so does the regulatory structure to manage it. Our economic and cultural relationships
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law rel=noopener>produce</a> (and are produced by) the

Because of this relationship, modern limits are most often derived in the postulations of distant institutions, composed of people with more credentials than context. Context is difficult to achieve when the scale of our economies is not in sync with our capacity for affection.</p><p>Modern economies and their institutions, despite their obsession with

<a href=https://news.gallup.com/poll/403124/majority-continues-say-government-powerful.aspx rel=noopener>cannot</a> produce enough understanding to reason about the limits with meaningful sensitivity to specific places. Institutions that must consider their roles so broadly shape the places they attempt to manage in their own image and at the expense of our individual and community agency.</p><a href=#limits-derived-in-empathetic-relationship><h3 id=limits-derived-in-empathetic-relationship><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Limits Derived in Empathetic Relationship</h3></a><p>Small, local economies, with organizational structures informed by generational and empathetic relationships provide a better framework for establishing sustainable limits than institutional decision-makers.</p><p>Many great thinkers from

<a href=https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/thought-limits-prodigal-age rel=noopener>Wendell Berry</a> have articulated the existential urgency of grounding society in local relationships. The fidelity of their insight now becomes more evident every year as we search for a society with both agency and the ability to live within limits.</p><p>Through the course of this series of essays, we&rsquo;ll work toward an understanding of why new tools for collective coordination may help us approach this vision of local agency with new vigor. With the help of these tools, over time sovereign communities can be scaffolded into a more broadly connected network, more vibrant and less fragile than any more centrally coordinated organizational system, yet still broadly coherent.</p><p>Enduring structures of household and family life or the life of a community or the life of a country, cannot be formed except within limits.

This posture flows out of my previous work in
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_planning#Rational_planning_tradition rel=noopener>urban planning</a>, but I think it&rsquo;s an appropriate foundation for cultivating a healthy society because our experience of life is so necessarily deeply embedded in the places we make our lives.</p><p>Places are uniquely persistent in their effect on culture from generation to generation, more
