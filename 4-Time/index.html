itself</a>.</p><blockquote><p>We have had in only about two centuries a steady and ever-quickening
sequence of industrial revolutions in manufacturing, transportation,
war, agriculture, education, entertainment, homemaking and family
life, health care, and so-called communities. All of these changes
have depended upon industrial technologies, processes, and products.
[&mldr;] But what technology can replace personal privacy or the
coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the
collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?</p><p>&mdash; Wendell Berry, <i><a href=https://spiritoftheland.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/It-All-Turns-On-Affection-Wendell-Berry.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>It All Turns on

place-agnostic internet or hoping for a future that is enduring only in
its failure to arrive? How can we ground ourselves appropriately in
time? Only through our home places.</p><p>Historically, long-standing connections between people and their places
have rooted their traditions and their collective memory in a slow-paced
ecological rhythm, but this was not necessarily out of some prescient
wisdom. Before the technological capability to regularly consume
resources from anywhere on earth, communities necessarily had to more
fully provide for themselves within the context of their local
environment.</p><p>While our consumption is no longer technically restrained to our places
in the same way, local affection and relationship to a specific place is
still the best way to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-DUcbk58OI&t=41s" target=_blank rel=noopener>orient</a>
ourselves in time. Without this
<a href=https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Totem target=_blank rel=noopener>anchor</a>, we lose
our ability to perceive ecological limits and build stable identities to
carry us forward over the coming generations. Resilience is no longer
something we inherit from our places, but something we must choose by
binding ourselves to them.</p><blockquote><p>The Amish are far less captive to the future than the rest of us, and
that is because their lives are so complexly serviceable to their land
and their neighbors in the present. And so they are providing for the
future as fully and effectively as humans possibly can.</p><p>&mdash; Wendell Berry, <i>The Art of Loading Brush</i></p></blockquote><a href=#redefining-progress><h3 id=redefining-progress><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>Redefining Progress</h3></a><p>Because of the sanctity of our home places, we cannot see the future as
some infinite piggy bank from which to draw. Solving problems by
assuming resources will be readily supplied by outside communities at
some unspecified point in the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism target=_blank rel=noopener>future</a>
is not innovation or progress but laziness and greed&mdash; a &ldquo;movement from
old damage to new destruction,&rdquo; as Berry puts it.</p><blockquote><p>As a people we have escaped to the West from the East, from the
country to the city, from the city to the suburbs, from the suburbs
back to the country or back to the city. And because we have never
known well enough, or worked well enough, where we were, this has
almost always been a movement from old damage to new destruction, and
always with the aim of 'a better future for our children'.</p><p>&mdash; Wendell Berry, <i>The Art of Loading Brush</i></p></blockquote><p>Generational thinking avoids the kind of overuse and excess that

may suggest. Instead, we can sustain our communities joyfully both
through the present day and coming generations by leaning on place-based
traditions as a foundation for agency, trust, and humility.</p><p>Instead of unsustainable growth by the accrual of existential debt,
progress should be defined by a community&rsquo;s capacity to maintain the
kind of equilibrium that allows it to &lsquo;

changing world than dependence on broad and abstract organizational
structures.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Because a thing is going strong now, it need not go strong for ever,&rdquo;

the Soviet Union, governance tried to ignore the constraints of

an institution as simply &ldquo;a relationship or shared endeavor, in which
multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or
other features which constrain or motivate participants&rsquo; behaviors.&rdquo;
Governance, families, and even language are institutions that, aided
with
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYDuOKI8maQ&t=335s" target=_blank rel=noopener>broadly
defined</a>
&rsquo;technologies&rsquo; like legal frameworks and voting protocols, can scale and
perpetuate these traditions to allow us to better coordinate our home
places.</p><a href=#illegibility-and-relationship><h3 id=illegibility-and-relationship><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>Illegibility and Relationship</h3></a><p>These modes of organizing society are not just abstract universal
systems; they are in deep relationship with the physical and cultural
landscapes they inhabit. At the same time&mdash;and while acknowledging our
current overdependence on centralized institutions and
technologies&mdash;not every process needs to be recreated at the local
level in order to begin to impart greater agency to communities. While
common language among a community is important, for example, there is no
objective measure of what kind of scale is ideal.</p><p><a href="https://folklife.si.edu/magazine/own-words-himalayan-languages-sichuan#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe-are-all-Qiang%2C-but-our-dialects%2C-traditions%2C-folklore%2C-and-beliefs-vary-widely-by-valley-or-even-by-village%2C%E2%80%9D-Jianqiong-explains.-%E2%80%9CAs-far-as-Black-Tiger-goes%2C-it%E2%80%99s-pretty-different.-I-can-understand-about-thirty-percent-of-the-words%2C-but-it-is-hard-to-follow.%E2%80%9D" target=_blank rel=noopener>Some communities in southwestern
China</a>
maintain a common language only local to their village, with neighboring
communities having trouble understanding each other. Many of these
languages have formed in direct relation to the steep valleys these
communities have inhabited for centuries, with

representative of valley geography (up-river and down-river instead of
north/south). For them, this level of scale is appropriate and the level
of linguistic/ecological intimacy is worth preserving.</p><p>In contrast, the nearly global scale of the English language creates
advantages for global business but also may not be able to retain local
memory as well as a smaller language. While there are indeed benefits to

to broader regulatory structures, a language for every village is
probably not the sweet spot for the coordination of resilient physical
communities at this point in humanity's development.</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=/media/image11.jpg height><div style=text-align:left;display:inline-block;width:70%><text style="font-style: italic; font-size: .9em;">A photo I took in one such valley-bound <a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/wFDAX1ooHZhgDSBk6 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">village</a> in Sichuan in 2013.

monolithic unilaterally coordinated institutions, we can employ
technological
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZOOWZTaFNA&t=545s" target=_blank rel=noopener>architectures</a>
and tools that respect and support local sovereignty, but network local
places into coherent regional and national polycentric relationship.</p><a href=#local-technologies><h3 id=local-technologies><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>Local Technologies</h3></a><p>So how can we determine which tools are productive in moving toward such
a sustainable,
<a href="https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/long-distance-thinking?s=r" target=_blank rel=noopener>long-thinking</a>
society? There is nothing inherently wrong with organizational
structures that span geographies, especially when they serve as
scaffolding for relationships between local places&mdash;but when local
traditions are themselves shaped in service of these structures, we put
the cart before the horse. What is the use of relating at scale if the
tools for coordinating these complex relationships require reduced local
fidelity? If national policy goals or technologies gain control over
local social traditions, the system breaks down.</p><p>Organizational flows of influence, then, should be in the direction of

circles,</a>
moving outward as a ripple emanating from small communities. In this
architecture, natural ecologies inform local social traditions of care,
which inform local formal methods for organization, which in turn inform
broader formal conventions of relationship.</p><a href=#new-technologies-and-locally-sensitive-alternatives-to-institutions><h3 id=new-technologies-and-locally-sensitive-alternatives-to-institutions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>New Technologies and Locally Sensitive Alternatives to Institutions</h3></a><p>Though today our technologies mostly erode our individual and community
sovereignty, tools for coordination surely have a place in any healthy
society. Chapter 5 and 6 of this series will dig further into emerging
technological pathways for the pursuit of endogenous
sovereignty&mdash;including collaborative tools for &lsquo;

social flexibility and local sensitivity to support us in building
healthy, long-thinking communities with more robust generational memory
