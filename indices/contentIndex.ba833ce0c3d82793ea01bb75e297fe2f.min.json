Agency \u0026 Limits","content":"# 1.  Agency \u0026 Limits\n_For a Generationally Healthy Society_\n\nEmpathetic relationships with the people and places around us yield agency bounded by affection. In the absence of healthy relationship, distant institutions attempt control for the sake of moderation but achieve neither, producing only apathy.\n\nWhile often it is a crisis that awakens us from our listlessness and catalyzes meaningful change, new modes of collective coordination promise pathways for more sustainable propagation of agency.\n\nThis is the introductory piece in a series exploring agency and limits as prerequisite to sustainable communities.\n\n{{\u003cquote text=\"The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place\" author=\"\u003ca href='https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency'\u003eSimon Sarris\u003c/a\u003e\"\u003e}}\n\n[Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(philosophy)) is the capacity to [shape](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6875140-the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world-is-that-it) the world around (and [within](https://twitter.com/cognazor/status/1599097257923514368)) us through action. The presence of this capacity is foundational to a functional society, and its absence today is the cause of many of our collective malformations.\n\nThe depletion of the [Aral Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp0Sxn42TGs) stands as one such malformation. Why a bureaucracy of powerful and educated people produced a generations-long environmental and social disaster in the management of the world's fourth largest lake, while traditions of collectively managed irrigation systems have been thriving among uneducated peasants for centuries in [New Mexico](https://newmexiconomad.com/acequias/), [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subak_(irrigation)), [Spain](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comunidad_de_regantes), [Nepal](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-economicsciences2009.pdf) and [India](https://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/pani-panchayat-model-groundwater-management-presentation-acwadam) forms the philosophical basis for our investigation.\n\n## Agency in Context\n\nAlthough it is [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpBOgh2zxtE) more semiotically convenient to regard agency as a phenomenon of the individual, a rich and enduring state of individual self-determination is only achieved when communities produce it together, for each other.\n\nJust as vital to agency as our _interpersonal_ relationships are our relationships with the physical places we make our lives in. These places existed long before our intervention, and will surely outlast us. At the same time they are, inescapably, an accumulation of their collective communal management up until this point. Only by both attuning ourselves to the unique ecology of our specific place and carrying a deep memory of local traditions of placemaking can we cultivate thriving communities sustainably.\n\n## Agency and Limits\n\nGiven our own agency's relationship to people and place over generations, capacity to shape the world does not connote an invitation to limitless consumption, but instead relies on our faculty for [affection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcvJs6RS2Ek) and the extension of trust in and with our [home place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS3-PffLKqM\u0026t=1100s).\n\nAs technology broadens our [capacity](https://newdesigncongress.org/en/about#:~:text=now%20work%20as-,accelerants,-%E2%80%93%20exacerbating%20social%2C%20political) to consume, the means by which limits are formed has become more an existential than technical question. It is not that natural limits have been transcended, but that our technology allows us to more easily externalize the effects of our consumption. Part of fostering agency in society, then, relies on our capacity to [conjure our own source of discipline](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/mmt/#:~:text=But%20a%20monetary%20sovereign%20has%20to%20conjure%20its%20own%20source%20of%20discipline.). The means by which we foster these limits are the subject of this series of essays.\n\n### Limits Derived in Institutions\n\nAs the [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter#:~:text=as%20Roman%20agricultural,of%20more%20territory.) of our consumption expands, so does the regulatory structure to manage it. Our economic and cultural relationships [produce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) (and are produced by) the [institutions](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=institution%20%E2%80%93%2D%20a%20relationship%20or%20shared%20endeavor%2C%20in%20which%20multiple%20people%20repeatedly%20participate%2C%20and%20featuring%20customs%2C%20rules%2C%20or%20other%20features%20which%20constrain%20or%20motivate%20participants%E2%80%99%20behaviors) that manage them. Because of this relationship, modern limits are most often derived in the postulations of distant institutions, composed of people with more credentials than context. Context is difficult to achieve when the scale of our economies is not in sync with our capacity for affection.\n\nModern economies and their institutions, despite their obsession with [absorbing data](https://hbr.org/2012/04/good-data-wont-guarantee-good-decisions), [cannot](https://news.gallup.com/poll/403124/majority-continues-say-government-powerful.aspx) produce enough understanding to reason about the limits with meaningful sensitivity to specific places. Institutions that must consider their roles so broadly shape the places they attempt to manage in their own image and at the expense of our individual and community agency.\n\n### Limits Derived in Empathetic Relationship\n\nSmall, local economies, with organizational structures informed by generational and empathetic relationships provide a better framework for establishing sustainable limits than institutional decision-makers.\n\nMany great thinkers from [Gandhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lnK8-PoXQ\u0026t=1695s) to [Wendell Berry](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/thought-limits-prodigal-age) have articulated the existential urgency of grounding society in local relationships. The fidelity of their insight now becomes more evident every year as we search for a society with both agency and the ability to live within limits.\n\nThrough the course of this series of essays, we'll work toward an understanding of why new tools for collective coordination may help us approach this vision of local agency with new vigor. With the help of these tools, over time sovereign communities can be scaffolded into a more broadly connected network, more vibrant and less fragile than any more centrally coordinated organizational system, yet still broadly coherent.\n\nEnduring structures of household and family life or the life of a community or the life of a country, cannot be formed except within limits. We must not outdistance local knowledge and affection.\n\n{{\u003cquote text=\"Enduring structures of household and family life or the life of a community or the life of a country, cannot be formed except within limits.

This posture flows out of my previous work in [urban planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_planning#Rational_planning_tradition), but I think it's an appropriate foundation for cultivating a healthy society because our experience of life is so necessarily deeply embedded in the places we make our lives.\n\nPlaces are uniquely persistent in their effect on culture from generation to generation, more [enduring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Istanbul) than the organizational structures that manage them. Any healthy management of communities, then, must acknowledge the local biophysical reality it exists in.\n\nThe fact that our generation's impact on the physical world will outlive us is painfully clear in almost every American city today. The legacy of [gutting downtowns](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8605917/highways-interstate-cities-history) in service of [highways](https://twitter.com/lennartnout/status/1449985513591558144) is something we are still trying to [amend](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/27/climate/us-cities-highway-removal.html) today.\n\nDecisions being made now will [impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsT9V3WQiNA\u0026t=383s) our great grandchildren, and yet most Americans don't have a role to play in building and maintaining their neighborhoods. Since they are so permanent, however, it's time to begin to think more clearly about how to improve the way we make places together over generations.\n\n{{\u003cimage src=\"/jgcfyi/jgcfyi/images/1/map.jpg\" height=\"600px\" caption=\"Boston \u003ca href='https://www.reddit.com/r/OldPhotosInRealLife/comments/s3b3d0/boston_1938_vs_1969_before_the_big_dig/'\u003ebefore and after\u003c/a\u003e I-93 was built through the middle of downtown\"\u003e}}\n\n## Agency and Disengagement\n\nIt is [well established](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5002400/) in the fields of psychology and mental health that self-determination and agency are [important factors](https://www.mindful.org/seven-ways-to-develop-personal-agency/#:~:text=People%20with%20low%20agency%20experience,and%20they%20act%20on%20impulse.) in a healthy life.

Ironically, these systems of institutional abstraction break down local generational memory and tradition, exactly the things that have traditionally produced lighter individual burdens of choice in the past.\n\nThe longer our apathetic dependence on distant and opaque systems of organization goes on, the more out of tune we become with traditions of placemaking that have grown alongside the specific ecology of our place.

Innovative organizational structures, in rhythm with natural ecologies, can support these relationships in ways that scaffold into a polycentric organizational mycelium.\n\n3. **_Limits_**\n\n    Society can only offer agency predictably if not subjected to the kinds of existential risks of catastrophe introduced by dependence on distant economies and institutions. Affectionate and empathetic relationship with the people and places around us can help more effectively diffuse these risks.\n\n4. **_Agency in the Context of Time and Place_**\n\n    Agency and limits are strongly supported by tradition and generational knowledge transfer, rooted in specific place. Considering cyclic equilibrial investment and draw from generational resources is necessary for a healthy society to be embodied in time and place. This is the long view of building a culture of agency.\n\n5. **_Rooting the Internet in Community and Place_**\n\n    Technologies can work either to take power from small communities, or to give it back. While recent history suggests they have a tendency towards the former, technological innovations have been catalysts for decentralized social organizational change throughout history. New systems of shared value-making on the internet may help us to reverse a technological tendency towards centralization, and deliver vital agency at the local level.\n\n6. **_Digital Tools for Empowered Placemaking_**\n\n    Our experience of life is deeply embedded in our place. New tools for collective action, identity formation, and ownership are poised to shift sovereignty back to small communities at more appropriate fidelity of placemaking.","lastmodified":"2023-06-01T23:17:54.408296489Z","tags":["Agency and Limits"]},"/jgcfyi/2-Agency":{"title":"2-Agency","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-01T23:17:54.408296489Z","tags":[]},"/jgcfyi/3-Limits":{"title":"3-Limits","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-01T23:17:54.408296489Z","tags":[]},"/jgcfyi/4-Context":{"title":"4-Context","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-01T23:17:54.408296489Z","tags":[]},"/jgcfyi/5-Rooting-the-Internet-in-Community-And-Place":{"title":"5.

Networks of BBSs like [Fidonet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) even created protocols for interrelation of small communities remarkably similar to the polycentric organizational structures we discussed in Chapter 2.\n\nFor Internet users today, there is more to the BBS story than mere nostalgia.

There are also those technologies that build local resilience. EF Schumacher and Ivan Illich were thinking about these [intermediate technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology) and [tools for conviviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality) already in the 1970s.\n\nJust as the [printing press](https://www.history.com/news/printing-press-renaissance) distributed the power of knowledge once centralized in religious institutions and the [internet](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=109868) distributed the power of voice once centralized in media institutions, tools of crypto have the potential to distribute the power of money and other systems of value management now with high degrees of centralized risk. One [federal bank](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/economy/federal-reserve-global-fallout.html) deciding the [fate of the world](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1605413877985968128) economy is not how value worked [historically](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/properties-of-money/#:~:text=For%20a%20phenomenal%20review%20of%20money%E2%80%99s%20historical%20plurality%2C%20see%20Akinobu%20Kuroda%E2%80%99s%20A%20Global%20History%20of%20Money.), and it is likely not a permanent or healthy current feature of our global economic system. Crypto goes far beyond money as well, with the possibility to remake systems of record-keeping independent of states.\n\nIf you've read the previous installments of this series, it should be clear that I don't think [technology](https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1596918140545691652) can solve all the problems we face today. Healthy society depends primarily on our ability to form relationships with our neighbors and the places we live over generations. I do think, though, that we can use technology to further those endeavors.\n\nI won't do any more qualifying since I've also already devoted a whole list of general notes on the philosophy of my writing here. Below I'll discuss the historical precedent for technologies of disintermediation and then discuss what new opportunities we have today to make our society more healthy in the tradition of these precedents.\n\n_A Note on Infrastructure_\n\nWhile we still have a great deal of [dependence](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/08/77139/) on centrally managed [physical infrastructure](https://cip.gmu.edu/2016/10/26/understanding-physical-internet-infrastructure-vulnerabilities/#:~:text=the%20existence%20of%20a%20single%20physical%20structure%20that%20houses%20so%20many%20important%20connections%20represents%20a%20vulnerability%20with%20the%20potential%20for%20serious%20cascading%20consequences%20for%20global%20Internet%20routing.) for internet connectivity today, physical [peer-to-peer infrastructure](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Main_Page) such as [mesh networks](https://urbanomnibus.net/2019/10/building-the-peoples-internet/) can and must be a necessary [synergistic companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) to the kinds of tools for decentralized (digital) organizational infrastructure discussed in this chapter. We cannot have communities with agency if they do not have [agency over their tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_clFVHKS2g) for organization, and the [tools](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/from-domination-to-partnership#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20not%20that%20people%20are%20incapable%20of%20collaboration%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20just%20that%20most%20of%20us%20lack%20tools%2C%20skills%20and%20role%20models) themselves play a part in imparting agency.\n\n_A Note on Digital Agency_\n\nThe [erosion](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1503822879552688129) of opportunities for building agency in the physical world has led some to pursue [digital-first sovereignty](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1547851370924892161). I [acknowledge](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1548028452355182593) that [sometimes](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency#:~:text=(There%20are%20good,Start%20typing.)) digital agency is the only path to agency people have available.\n\nHowever, I am [doubtful](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1548028447561134090)[this approach](https://thenetworkstate.com/) can lead to healthy communities with agency. Digital tools can be powerful for scratching our natural itch for agency, but they should be anchored in a physical reality to avoid [manipulation](https://towardsdatascience.com/algorithmic-behavior-modification-by-big-tech-is-crippling-academic-data-science-research-c600d4fe696b) and dependency. The physical world is vital to our existence and the health of a community depends on the physical health of its people. Without a relationship to the physical world, any prospect of digital agency is at best precarious and at worst illusory.\n\n[https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1548028450891476992](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1548028450891476992)\n\n**A History of Societal Change Spurred by Technology**\n\nWhile the most immediate example to us, the internet isn't the first technology to challenge the legitimacy of presiding institutions. These kinds of technology-based organizational transitions have been taking place throughout history, and will be useful in understanding what opportunities for societal innovation we may have in the internet and community computers. These thoughts are based on some fantastic resources from [Ethan Buchman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9C1Y89Txdw), [Jon Hillis](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8), and [Josh Rosenthal](https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-the-crypto-renaissance-josh-rosenthal-e35) (among many others).\n\n[https://twitter.com/Narodism/status/1592226566951559169](https://twitter.com/Narodism/status/1592226566951559169)\n\nHistorians have noticed a [common](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/communal-computing/#:~:text=In%20design%2C%20there%20is%20a%20technique%20diverge%2Dconverge)[cycle](https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/617161) of decentralization and re-centralization associated with social technological leaps in the past. Technologies that enable new ways of coordinating catch on quickly at the interpersonal level, injecting energy, engagement, and even [solidarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah) into organizational structures.\n\nIncumbent (and more centralized) institutions can't keep up with these new organic structures, so the process is naturally decentralizing. New and remade institutions attempt to stabilize and scale the once decentralized and interpersonal movement, at the sake of local agency. In the institutional representation, process supersedes local sensitivity and relationship, and the 'efficient' institution is unable to represent the diversity of its constituents. The scaled organizational structure eventually begins to feel the dead weight of its overextended borders. This structural weakness is often met again by new social technologies or other catalysts for change when the time is right.\n\nSome examples of social technologies that were [catalysts](https://dark.fi/insights/ftx-where-next.html#:~:text=Evolution%20is%20not%20a%20steady%20progression%20of%20mechanical%20optimizations.%20It%20is%20more%20like%20an%20orchestra.%20Periods%20of%20sombre%20stability%20and%20balance%20are%20punctuated%20by%20incredibly%20violent%20but%20short%20episodes%20of%20change.) for [cultural phase transition](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/35#c1:~:text=A%20new%20study%20suggests%20that%20this%20process%20involves%20a%20kind%20of%20phase%20transition%20in%20which%20the%20%E2%80%9Cdeep%20structure%E2%80%9D%20of%20a%20language%20crystallizes%20out%20abruptly%20as%20grammar%20rules%20are%20intuited%20by%20the%20learner.) include:\n\n- [Cooperative, common-pool irrigation](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8#:~:text=Irrigation%20provides%20a%20path%20for%20large%2Dscale%20cooperation) - which expanded agricultural capabilities\n- Greek [Alphabets](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8#:~:text=Alphabets%20are%20interchangeable%20parts%20for%20the%20mind) - which led to broader trade and language dissemination\n- [The Printing Press](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8#:~:text=Printing%20press%3A%20interchangeable%20parts%20for%20alphabets) - which greatly expanded publicly available written material\n- [Templates for cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8#:~:text=it%20didn%E2%80%99t%20scale.-,The%20art%20of%20reproducing%20cities,-As%20popular%20emerging) and [Market towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_town) - which led to [federations and city-states](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8#:~:text=A%20new%20league%20of%20city%2Dstates)\n- [Double Entry Bookkeeping](https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-the-crypto-renaissance-josh-rosenthal-e35#:~:text=used%20double%2Dentry%20booking%20to%20completely%20rework%20the%20financial%20system) - which greatly \"increased the power, leverage, velocity, composability and granularity of money\"\n\n**Physical Changes by Digital Means**\n\nFrom the [birth of agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_city#cite_note-1:~:text=The%20Neolithic%20revolution%20brought%20agriculture%2C%20which%20made%20denser%20human%20populations%20possible%2C%20thereby%20supporting%20city%20development.) to the [industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_city#Industrial_revolution), technologies have always influenced physical communities. Maybe the most obvious for us today is the ways in which [transportation technology](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-29/the-commuting-principle-that-shaped-urban-history)[shapes cities](https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter8/transportation-urban-form/evolution-transport-urban-form/). Depending on their periods of highest growth, cities have been built around walking and bodies of water, then street cars and early transit, and then cars. Today remote work can be viewed as a new technological shift affecting the city form, this time not ushered by physical transportation but by the mobility of communication afforded by the internet.\n\nThe internet has had a profound effect on our daily lives in recent decades, far beyond recent trends of remote work. Today, an increasing number of people spend [more](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/)[time](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-time-spent-with-connected-tech) on the internet than being physically present. But the internet is not just a retreat from the physical, it shapes the way we make our physical communities, with greater internet connectivity [moving](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/business/the-internet-as-an-influence-on-urbanization.html#:~:text=But%20to%20date%2C%20the%20impact%20of%20the%20Internet%20has%20been%20mainly%20to%20reinforce%20the%20economic%20and%20intellectual%20leadership%20of%20a%20handful%20of%20urban%20centers%20and%20nearby%20suburbs%2C%20according%20to%20an%20analysis%20by%20the%20Taub%20Urban%20Research%20Center%20at%20New%20York%20University.) less dense urban regions towards greater [physical](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248982) and [local-social](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2001/11/20/the-internet-cities-and-social-capital/)[cohesion](https://www.uh.edu/~kohlhase/CraigHoangKohlhase_internet_WP_Oct_2014.pdf) over time. Understanding how the iterations of the internet has and will impact our physical world, we can also [dream](https://pluriverse.world/) how we can make physical communities more resilient with a more empowered internet.\n\nI'm [not the first](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4954/3786) person to suggest that digital tools can help solve physical problems in cities, but I do want to specifically discuss the ways that new internet-based tools will impact collective coordination by more deeply engaging and empowering small groups of people to shape their immediate surroundings.\n\nIt's not that people are incapable of collaboration, it's just that most of us lack tools - [Richard D. Bartlett](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/from-domination-to-partnership)\n\nRelational modes of sharing and transferring value, like [cooperatives](https://cultivate.coop/wiki/Films_and_Videos_on_Cooperatives), are often more organizationally burdensome today than \"typical\" market-based economics. Elinor Ostrom recognized the 'tragedy of the commons' in [common pool resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource) to often be a problem of coordination, [saying](https://youtu.be/T6OgRki5SgM?t=2216): \"we found that groups that did not communicate were more likely to overuse their resources … But all we had to do was to introduce the possibility of face to face communication, and that allowed them to increase cooperation.\" When allowed to cooperate to design systems of managing common pool resources, local people often [outperform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6OgRki5SgM\u0026t=1779s) institutional intervention. New tools of [agentic coordination](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/communal-computing/#:~:text=of%20the%20internet%3F-,Agentic%20software,-embodies%20a%20Hundertwasser) can help support broader adoption of these old ideas, but only if they are [sufficiently learnable](https://venkatesh-rao.gitbook.io/summer-of-protocols/#_ozkudrau5sjb) to a broad enough demographic.\n\nWe must make it possible for the average layperson to be able to change and adapt software for their own needs; for them to experience creating software not like a professional chef, but a home cook.\n\n- Jacky Zhao, [_Communal Computing Networks_](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/communal-computing/#:~:text=We%20must%20make%20it%20possible%20for%20the%20average%20layperson%20to%20be%20able%20to%20change%20and%20adapt%20software%20for%20their%20own%20needs%3B%20for%20them%20to%20experience%20creating%20software%20not%20like%20a%20professional%20chef%2C%20but%20a%20home%20cook.)\n\nCommunity computers and other collaborative technologies can support movements like [cosmolocalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_localism) to help build the digital commons that serves as common knowledge-sharing infrastructure and toolset for local places to thrive and improve local coordination and physical production.\n\nThis kind of coordination can be fun and intuitive, and has yielded local collaboration for production of everything from [industrial machinery](https://www.opensourceecology.org/) and 3D printed [guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlB2QV5wVxg) to [frog houses](https://twitter.com/Brieyonce/status/1630051041524760576?s=20) and [park benches](https://www.betterblock.org/wikiblock). If given more agency in placemaking, I picture a world where empowered people share knowledge to make home building and [other forms](http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/) of physical community building more collaborative and spontaneous as well.\n\n**Practically Speaking…. So What?**\n\nI concede that theoretical possibilities of change do not imply certainty of change. Just because technologies have changed specific places in the past does not mean community computing will do that in the future. There is a real possibility that the disruptive nature of these technologies, combined with their open nature (they may also empower illegal activities) means that development of these social systems continues, but has to do so in the [shadows](https://dark.fi/manifesto.html) as regulatory oversight becomes burdensome. In the end, these systems may only provide an escape valve from the most oppressive of states [rather than a broad social movement](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1598051030117552131) that moves small communities in many places forward.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, these technologies [already are being used today](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html#:~:text=Over%20the%20past,cities%20from%20scratch.) in small ways that could pave the way for meaningful cultural change. I'll get into some specific examples in our final chapter, but first I'd like to define the spirit of the technology we're discussing a bit more specifically.\n\n**Defining an 'Empowered Internet'**\n\nThere is already a parallel internet being built by groups and individuals looking for an oasis from the irrelational scale and surveillance made possible by the modern internet. In the 90s, these people were a small group called [cypherpunks](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html). These are the forefathers of bitcoin and what is today called [crypto](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/). Because of the open nature of the internet, and the implications of involving money so closely with political ideology and conviction, opinions on what 'crypto' even is today vary greatly. I won't try to form some all-encompassing definition, but would like to identify some key cultural touchstones that will help [contextualize](https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0#:~:text=Understanding%20blockchains%20as%20a%20source%20of%20hardness%20also%20helps%20us%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20dizzying%20array%20of%20narratives%20and%20buzzwords%20that%20have%20been%20used%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20them%20over%20time%3A) how these technologies apply to local relational economies. (If you are looking for an intro to crypto in general, I suggest [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/) piece by Matt Levine)\n\nCypherpunk philosophy is fundamentally about leveraging this precious asymmetry to create a world that better preserves the autonomy of the individual, and cryptoeconomics is to some extent an extension of that, except this time protecting the safety and liveness of complex systems of coordination and collaboration, rather than simply the integrity and confidentiality of private messages.\n\n- Vitalik Buterin, [_A Proof of Stake Design Philosophy_](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51#:~:text=Cypherpunk%20philosophy%20is,of%20private%20messages)\n\n_Digital Sovereignty and Resilience_\n\nDigital sovereignty is perhaps the most basic pursuit of these technologies, meaning the right of individuals and communities to exist on the internet without interference. These principles are tightly tied with [privacy](https://safecomputing.umich.edu/privacy/history-of-privacy-timeline), since a lack of privacy can result in altered behavior, through fearful self-censorship or in response to intervention by surveilling institutions, of which the internet has a [long tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Lantern_(software)) of.\n\nDistributed systems that grant sovereignty and privacy by default to individuals make surveillance harder for states. What they give up in [control](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2022/6/29/local-control-or-centralized-planning-theres-a-third-answer#:~:text=And%20the%20latter%2C%20perhaps%20paradoxically%2C%20requires%20relinquishing%20some%20control%20and%20tolerating%20a%20little%20more%20chaos), though, is gained in resilience by allowing citizens to engage more deeply in maintaining their own tools and cultures themselves.\n\n_Empowered Participation Through Direct Ownership_\n\nThroughout most of human history, people were compelled to engage deeply with the place around them, the land and their neighbors, because it was their only option. Today the path of least resistance is outsourcing all home or place-making activities in exchange for money.\n\nEven local governments often use outside [consultants](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/industries/government-public-services.html?icid=top_government-public-services) to accomplish most of their work. Community computing networks allow people to build tools where they can own and actively participate in the important services they rely on rather than paying a 'specialist' outside the community. This infrastructure provides a more relational and engaging path to community management.\n\n_Composability \u0026 Openness_\n\nFor many examples of possible uses of community computing, often the question is asked pointedly, \"[why does this need to be on a blockchain](https://blockchainforgov.org/)?\" One of those reasons is that distributed protocols lend native [composability](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/). This means that infrastructure can be integrated together, bringing tools in relationship. This is crucial for networks that allow payment, voting, and identity solutions because each new tool benefits the others. These open maps of relationships, when combined with appropriate privacy considerations, can produce new kinds of [collaborative](https://cofi.informal.systems/) synergistic relationships that are impossible to achieve in a world of [intellectual proprietarianism](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Beyond_Foucault_Excursions_in_Political/o4hyDwAAQBAJ?hl=en\u0026gbpv=1\u0026pg=PA121\u0026printsec=frontcover).\n\nIn order to see spontaneous and creative growth, we need credibly neutral platforms on which to build, with low barriers for creation, something that you can trust to build on – there are parallels to cities, where people know they are dependent on developers and the city, who may change rules … and so there is no incentive for spontaneous creativity.\n\n- [Chris Dixon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50)\n\n_Social Scalability_\n\nNick Szabo pioneered the argument that blockchains allow institutions to scale beyond what is typically locally and socially viable through traditional means, calling this [social scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=Social%20scalability%20is,can%20successfully%20participate.). Many of the failures of today's institutions are not necessarily because they are _too large_, but that the technology and organizational structures they are built on are no longer able to remain sensitive to interpersonal relationship at their current scale. Some advocates argue that blockchains can remake standards of relating at scale that universally allow anyone to participate, but in a way that more fully guarantees sensitivity and spontaneity at the local level.\n\nThe number and variety of people who can successfully participate in an online institution is far less often restricted by the objective limits of computers and networks than it is by limitations of mind and institution that have not yet been sufficiently redesigned or further evolved to take advantage of those technological improvements.\n\n- [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo), [_Money, blockchains, and social scalability_](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=the%20number%20and,those%20technological%20improvements.)\n\n**Cultural Diversity in Crypto**\n\nWhile open systems can create the right conditions for agency, there is the [tendency](https://theblockchainsocialist.com/talking-politics-with-vitalik-buterin-part-2/) in the world of crypto to design cultural discretion away in order to make these systems ready for any level of [adversity](https://bank.dev/why#:~:text=Understanding%20that%20every%20theoretical%20incentive%20incompatability%20is%20guaranteed%20to%20be%20exploited.). Systems like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) are designed in an open way in order to accommodate general purpose use with no need for social context or permission. The ability to make permanent, uncensorable tools is important, but so is the ability to have [stewardable](https://venkatesh-rao.gitbook.io/summer-of-protocols/#_1znhggknfsxb), [socially responsive technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyaWFicSihE). In her [research](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-economicsciences2009.pdf), Elinor Ostrom found that locally maintained systems often work better than 'superior' engineered solutions because the former are maintained with active engagement. Permanent systems designed without the need for maintenance are susceptible to disuse and disengagement.\n\n{{\u003c tweet user=\"jgcfyi\" id=\"1524480548802023426\" \u003e}}\n\nThis tension between the universal accessibility of formal and rigid systems and the invitation to local spontaneous engagement potentiated by informal systems has been the subject of debates that have emerged in the communities of [Ethereum](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=i.-,Ethereum,-The%20computer%20that) and [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/). Ethereum is [best](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1540427123839713280) when it functions as an [immutable](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=i.-,Censorship%20resistance,-Ordinarily%2C%20if%20there%E2%80%99s) and permanent source of 'universal' truth. This helps make tools composable and interoperable, over time building a robust web of resilient (independently maintained) infrastructure. On the other hand, [Cosmos](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1330600018777157633) (and future infrastructure like [Celestia](https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1548345842431455236)) provide localsovereignty at the community level, with more degrees of freedom in designing how to build and maintain social consensus.\n\nTogether, these new foundations can help forge pathways of agency, where specific empowered communities maintain locally sensitive community computing systems alongside universally available and reliable digital infrastructure in order to build strong local resilience and memory over generations. In the following chapter, we'll look more closely at the specific ways I expect these technologies to be employed most powerfully in the coming years.","lastmodified":"2023-06-01T23:17:54.408296489Z","tags":["Agency and Limits"]},"/jgcfyi/6-Specifics":{"title":"6-Specifics","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-01T23:17:54.408296489Z","tags":[]}}
