I welcome those resources and ask that we all acknowledge each other’s limits in knowledge & experience.<br>~~<br>Because of this, I view these ideas less as static and objective truth, and more a participation in a conversation with many other wonderful people.<br>~~ ~~<br>I admit it is difficult to not put a caveat or clarification after every statement when I write because I imagine objections to every thought. As a general rule for reading any work, I suggest you suspend your disbelief or skepticism. Take what inspires you and leave what you object to.<br>~~<br>Pessimism is more often less useful than optimism.<br>~~ ~~<br>Despite this series of essays coming together over more than 4 years of processing the ideas before sharing with you, maybe it is better that ideas progress in conversation with regular checkpoints of incomplete thought rather than in writing that is intended to be fully formed and stand on its own for years to come. Oh well, too late.<br>~~ ~~<br>“Panaceas are dysfunctional” -Elinor Ostrom<br>~~<br>Technology can&rsquo;t fix everything, but it can help some things<br>Traditionalism can&rsquo;t fix everything, but it can help some things<br>You can’t fix everything, but you can help some things<br>~~ ~~<br>If it feels like I’m just repeating other people&rsquo;s ideas, I’m ok with that. There are a lot of ideas in the world & the easiest way for new people to hear old ideas is for new people to talk about them. These things take time, repetition & contemplation to wade through—just like a mantra or a creed<br>~~ ~~<br>I don&rsquo;t need to be useful to all people. To some people what I’m writing will be intolerably cliche and to others it will be indigestibly opaque, but I hope someone out there will find it valuable.<br>~~ ~~<br>Sometimes simplification is beneficial but sometimes ideas need room to breathe and roll around in our minds. In these cases, simplification is counterproductive.<br>~~ ~~<br>I find there are two kinds of dialogue: explicit and suggestive. Both invoke dialogue—the first in its divisiveness, the second in the space it creates. I often err towards the former but claim no authority.<br>~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~<br><br></p><p><em>Practical Things</em><br>Links are sometimes giving credit for a specific reference but more often are simply a broad gesture intended to get you thinking or simply be playful.<br>~~ ~~<br>You&rsquo;ll find that the cursor of other visitors appears on your screen.
