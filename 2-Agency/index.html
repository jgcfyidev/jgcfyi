industrial model. It was based upon a hierarchical &ldquo;top-down&rdquo;

This model does not sufficiently reflect the kind of scientific

places with distinct local realities expends high levels of

This problem was the thrust of

of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and
therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical
form. The statistics which such a central authority would have to use
would have to be arrived at precisely by abstracting from minor
differences between the things, by lumping together&mldr; in a way which
may be very significant for the specific decision.</p><p>&mdash; FA Hayek, <em>The Use of Knowledge in Society</em></p></blockquote><a href=#overestimating-rationality><h3 id=overestimating-rationality><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>Overestimating Rationality</h3></a><p>A social theory called the

foreign donors, has built modern dams of concrete and steel. Despite
flawless engineering, many of these projects have ended in failure.
The reason is that the presence of durable dams has severed the ties
between head-end and tail-end users. Since the dams are durable, there
is little need for cooperation among users in maintaining the dams.
Therefore, head-end users can extract a disproportionate share of the
water without fearing the loss of tail-end maintenance labor.
Ultimately, the total crop yield is frequently higher around the
primitive dams than around the modern dams.</p><p>&mdash;

This movement is embodied in makerspaces&mdash;community-centered workshops
equipped with tools like

machines and 3D printers, and full of creators making their often open
source designs available globally online.

can help local places remain resilient and independent, while sharing
valuable information on manufacturing, farming and other necessary
skills to their mutual benefit.</p><blockquote><p>A relocalization which does not draw from a global knowledge and
design commons and which is relegated to only local knowledge can at
best produce &rsquo;lifeboat&rsquo; relocalization and at worst will not produce

networks can help to proliferate relevant local knowledge across
regions. This work is intimate, granting agency at the most local
levels, but also affords us the ability to weave these local
organizational systems into a collective, supportive whole through

In his 1925 book <em>The Collective Memory</em>, Maurice Halbwachs established
the deep influence that physical places have on the ability of
communities to maintain and transmit their collective identities and
histories.</p><blockquote><p>Most groups engrave their form in some way upon the soil and retrieve
their collective remembrances within the spatial framework.</p><p>&mdash;

crisis.</p><p>During the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Chicago_heat_wave target=_blank rel=noopener>1995 Chicago heat
wave</a>
that killed 739 people, certain neighborhoods produced fewer deaths,
even when accounting for other social factors like race and income.
Klinenberg found the reason was that these neighborhoods had better
social infrastructure&mdash;like shaded sidewalks, active street-level
vendors, and libraries that facilitated social relationships. Neighbors
in these places were much more likely to check in on each other during
the heatwave or notice that a certain neighbor was missing from their
daily routine.</p><p>As an alternative to the kind of agency-eroding

society, we cannot love them well without suitable tools of
coordination. Despite its recent contributions to our collective
forgetting of generational stewardship, technology should not be viewed
as the enemy of local resilience. The distinction must be made between
technologies that empower local agency and those which create dependency
on outside resources.</p><blockquote><p>Culture and individual memory are constantly produced through, and

parallel systems of organization with real legitimacy, especially with
the internet as a substrate for coordination. In subsequent parts of
