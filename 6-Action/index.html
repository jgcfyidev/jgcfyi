Delegated voting power can be revoked or changed in real time, and

is another innovation enabled by community computers. In this model
votes are continuous and can be changed at any time, but grow stronger
in weight over time if they are not changed. The ability for signals and

In such a system, the value of services provided by an individual or

<a href=https://vitalik.eth.limo/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Vitalik Buterin</a> is the
decentralized coordination of a conference. In this example, like-minded
people can place a deposit into a smart contract along with a preference
for a location. Once a threshold of deposits with a matching location is
met, money would be placed in a treasury and collectively managed by the
participants to coordinate the conference. Such a mechanism could
catalyze local neighborhood events or crowdfunded civic projects,
similar to existing organizations like
<a href=https://ioby.org/about target=_blank rel=noopener>Ioby</a>. This kind of opt-in
funding helps present a middle way between &lsquo;messy&rsquo; decentralized
dialogue-based coordination, and &lsquo;speed-optimized&rsquo; centralized control

<a href=https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/local-money-liquidity-saving/ target=_blank rel=noopener>broadly</a>,
local currencies are attempts at building sustainable, locally coherent
financial systems without outside dependencies. A simple step in this
direction is
<a href=https://www.mutualcredit.services/multilateral-obligation-set-off target=_blank rel=noopener>obligation-clearing</a>
(credit offset), where economic relationships are mapped and account
balances between participating parties settle at the end of an
established term, often per month. The beauty of this system is that it
is not necessary to alter economic behavior in order to significantly
reduce necessary cash in a sufficiently-connected economic map. While
this may not occur to you as exciting, late invoice payments can

disrupt the operations of small businesses.</p><blockquote><p>Participants mutually agree to allow a certain amount of value
