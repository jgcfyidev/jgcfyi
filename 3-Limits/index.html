reduce their viability, as was the case in Sri Lanka. Imposing outside
control over local systems can compound real ecological consequences in
ways that may not be immediately apparent to the institutions that
rendered them.</p><p>One such example is the classic story of the removal and reintroduction
of wolves to
<a href=https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Yellowstone National
Park</a>.
Wolves were once the top predator in the ecosystem, but
by the 1920s they had been effectively exterminated due to federal and
state-sponsored predator control programs aiming to protect
&rsquo;economically important&rsquo; livestock and game populations.</p><p>It was not until the 1960s that the resulting ecological imbalance
became evident. Elk became overpopulated, overgrazing willow and aspen
stands with ripple effects throughout the region, affecting other
species and leading to a substantial decrease in biodiversity.</p><p>After decades of debate, the effort to reintroduce wolves into
Yellowstone began in 1995. This simple step had a cascade effect to the
benefit of the entire local ecosystem. Wolves began to keep the elk
population in check, allowing vegetation to recover. The
recovery of willow stands provided more habitats for beavers, whose dams
create habitats for other species.</p><p>Despite the good result, the resource and time intensive process necessary simply to return to what were naturally sustainable ecologies should serve as a warning against the kind of <a href=https://www.institute.global/insights/tech-and-digitalisation/gene-editing-food-production-charting-way-forward>overzealous</a> institutional influence our home places rely on today.</p><div style=display:flex;flex-wrap:nowrap;flex-direction:row;align-items:center;gap:8px><div style=text-align:center;flex-basis:50%><img src=/media/image10.png height=600px><div><text style="font-style: italic; font-size: .9em;">The regrowth of willow stands after the <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320711004046?via%3Dihub target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">reintroduction</a> of wolves to Yellowstone <a href=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Trophic-cascades-in-Yellowstone%3A-The-first-15-years-Ripple-Beschta/04dd403deb56b90a65cc6fc67ba51d35242875eb/figure/3 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">(source)</a></text></div></div><div style=flex-basis:50%><p></p></div></div><a href=#limits-derived-in-empathetic-relationship><h2 id=limits-derived-in-empathetic-relationship><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>Limits Derived in Empathetic Relationship</h2></a><p>More sensitive local organizational structures can

This is seen in what has become the norm for master-planned communities,
where thousands of shiny new homes are built all at the same time. While
these communities often start as attractive places to live, over time,
