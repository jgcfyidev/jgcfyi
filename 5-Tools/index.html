presiding institutions (or to give way to new institutions). Keen
observers have noticed a common
<a href=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/617161 target=_blank rel=noopener>cycle</a>
of decentralization and re-centralization associated with social
technological leaps throughout history. In this pattern, technologies
that enable new ways of coordinating catch on quickly at the
interpersonal level, injecting energy, engagement, and even
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah target=_blank rel=noopener>solidarity</a> into
organizational structures.</p><p>Incumbent (and more centralized) institutions struggle to keep pace with
these emerging organic structures, so the process is naturally
decentralizing. As new and remade institutions attempt to stabilize and
scale the movement, process begins to supersede local sensitivity. This
&rsquo;efficient&rsquo; institution is again unable to represent the diversity of
its constituents, and the organizational structure begins to feel the
weight of its overextended borders. When the time is right, the
resulting structural weakness is often exposed and challenged by new
social technologies or other catalysts for change.</p><p>While this model fits the evolution of the internet itself, some other

A lack of privacy can result in altered behavior&mdash;either through

with their home place and their neighbors. Today the path of least
resistance is outsourcing all home and placemaking activities to
professionals in exchange for money. Even local governments often use
outside

our sensitivity to the people and places around us, and erodes the
health of our society.</p><p>Community computing networks allow people to build tools to own and
actively participate in the making of their community rather than paying
a &lsquo;specialist&rsquo; outside the community. This principle began with

provide a more relational and engaging path to community management more

<a href=https://blockchainforgov.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>why does this need to be on a

reasons is that distributed protocols lend
<a href=https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/ target=_blank rel=noopener>composability</a>.

including making &lsquo;users&rsquo; into collaborators, and the free sharing of
code.</p><blockquote><p>In order to see spontaneous and creative growth, we need credibly
neutral platforms on which to build, with low barriers for creation,
something that you can trust to build on. There are parallels to
cities, where people know they are dependent on developers and the

because they are by some definition <em>too large</em> but because the

Nick Szabo pioneered the argument that blockchains allow shared
endeavors (what he calls institutions) to scale beyond what is typically
locally and socially viable through traditional means, calling this

an online institution is far less often restricted by the objective
limits of computers and networks than it is by limitations of mind and
institution that have not yet been sufficiently redesigned or further
evolved to take advantage of those technological improvements.</p><p>&mdash;

appropriately integrate local sovereignty. Their infrastructure is not
mediated by any authority so the network is open to anyone by default,
without need for social context or permission. Most tools built on
blockchains are

Elinor Ostrom found that locally maintained systems often work better
than &lsquo;superior&rsquo; engineered solutions because the former are maintained
with active engagement. Permanent systems designed without the need for
maintenance are susceptible to disuse and disengagement. If the goal is
to improve systems of self-organization, then we must welcome social
process.</p><p>This tension between the universal

composable, interoperable, and free of dependencies&mdash;over time building
a robust web of resilient yet accessible infrastructure.</p><blockquote><p>Recently, we&rsquo;ve invented a new way to create hardness: blockchains.
Using an elegant combination of cryptography, networked software, and
incentives, we are able to create software and digital records that
have a degree of permanence.</p><p>&mdash;
