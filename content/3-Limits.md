## Outside Dependencies, Unknown Limits

As our economic systems continue to globalize and decouple from local
relationship, our communities increase their dependence on outside
resources. This dependence erodes local agency and leaves the
consequences of our actions to accumulate [out of
sight](https://atmos.earth/mezcal-oaxaca-environmental-impact/#:~:text=the%20spirit%E2%80%99s%20environmental%20toll%20back%20in%20Mexico%20remains%20hidden%20from%20most%20consumers.%C2%A0).
When some communities consume beyond their local capacity, others are
compelled to [produce
beyond](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac5419)
theirs. This imbalance embeds pathways of
[exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_theory)
into our economic system, often with our '<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/15/the-construction-industry-remains-horribly-climate-unfriendly?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&utm_source=google&ppccampaignID=17210591673&ppcadID=&utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7OqrBhD9ARIsAK3UXh1juWsfFNih08gr-bvOty-1E0Brzw8QqF9bd21dCz4tQ6VVPlUztWYaAtWpEALw_wcB" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>best</a>' places becoming the most dependent on this exploitation.

to greener pastures even when they themselves are responsible for
[degrading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_land)
those pastures. As a result, we have less and less personal relationship
to the food and products that sustain us, and so are not faced with the
implications of our consumption.

Such impersonal economies have strong incentives (both explicit and
implicit) against managing their
[risks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-020-01087-y).

and is the reason why globalized economies trend towards [local
decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Belt) over time.
Without the ability to account for accumulating problems locally, like
[toxins in
water](https://themainemonitor.org/a-spreading-problem-how-pfas-got-into-soils-and-food-systems/),
these consequences have cascaded into the broader existential
[weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_debt) of
climate change and
[increasing](https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049)
cancer rates.

### 'Growth' and Deferred Maintenance

The consequences of our economic relationships aren't only pushed out of
sight but also veiled in assumptions about a future we never bother to
imagine arriving. We do this every day by applying synthetic fertilizers
despite their deterioration of the soil or by using fossil fuels
despite the near-term inevitability of their exhaustion. These
precarious trajectories are often explained away because of assumptions
about future
[growth](https://www.ft.com/content/e1242c8e-e918-4eb5-9bf1-33d32c098b65)
or 'technological progress'.

As we saw in the history of German forestry, however, modes of
placemaking optimized for growth make us indebted to the future with no
guarantees the debt can be paid. Over time, management disconnected from
local places tends toward an
[insidious](https://twitter.com/StrangerJosh11/status/1624850269988061186)
[burden](https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/652421/south-africas-roads-are-collapsing/)
of deferred
[maintenance](https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/stockpile-food-and-water-south-africa-faces-civil-war-conditions-if-power-grid-collapses/news-story/231d976d93e9a34ef8dfaf0ac3db6582)
and [unfinished
work](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-07-11/china-s-hidden-debt-problem-laid-bare-in-city-s-empty-housing-unfinished-roads)
imposed on communities with no means of course correcting the
bureaucracy in charge.

{{<image src="/media/image21.jpg" caption="Once pristine but now forgotten malls (and then neighborhoods) like <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/fireatwillrva/6800796760/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>this one</a> are the ininevitable result of a society that moves in straight lines rather than cycles. In such a world, it's often better to abandon than to maintain. ">}}

In the making of our places, state and federal transportation

their tax-base when they [aren't
responsible](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2023-china-ev-graveyards/)
for maintenance. Politicians are glad to put their name behind flashy
projects promising growth if it means they get reelected. This burden of
maintenance grows with each new development, necessitating even more
growth to keep existing infrastructure functional.

Local people

will remain on the

of growth-beyond-means long after the consultants are gone. Lost lives
and abandoned communities can't be remedied by [more federal
dollars](https://www.epa.gov/superfund), but local people
won't know how to get out of these situations if they [weren\'t a
part](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/6/25/debt-is-not-a-funding-source#:~:text=They%20can%20cancel%20the%20future%20of%20a%20community%20in%20a%20way%20that%20is%20nearly%20indiscernible%20to%20the%20public%20until%20it%E2%80%99s%20too%20late.)
of getting there. Building locally derived traditions of organization,
then, is vital to the survival of our home places.

### Black Swans

In addition to decline through deferred maintenance, economies of scale
also carry the risks of less predictable but more catastrophic outcomes.
The relatively few fulcrums in large-scale systems mean there are fewer
mechanisms for
[proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception).
This can lead to [violent
collapses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyXwrpmt0zk) or
unwinding events, as
[unaccounted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)-for

real](https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world/)
consequences.

[Nassim
Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb)
has become well known for cautioning against [these
risks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyXwrpmt0zk) in
recent decades, but this phenomenon is not new. [Ibn Khaldun
described](https://www.mindattic.org/muqaddimah/#:~:text=these%20societies%20eventually%20lose%20the%20knowledge%20and%20skills%20to%20defend%20themselves%20from%20outside%20threats%20and%20end%20up%20employing%20outsiders%20for%20their%20protection.)
non-agentic dependence on outside resources as a precursor to societal
collapse as early as the 1300s in one of the [very
first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqaddimah)
sociological texts. As we prepare to outsource even more of our
faculties to [artificial
intelligence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities#),
the existential risks of total loss of agency are top of mind these
days.

## Institutions Reinforce the Accumulation of Risk

To account for the compounding externalities and existential risks of
our abstract economics, institutions seek to conjure limits for us,
inducing their own collection of problems. Their resulting impositions
are vulnerable to [regulatory
capture](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/-/media/Global/Files/policy/Climate-lobbying/2021-Climate-Lobbying-Report.pdf),
[arbitrage](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/16/un-review-carbon-offset-abuses),
and
[pushback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity,_Problem_Solving,_and_Sustainable_Societies#:~:text=bureaucratic%20regulation%20itself,complexity%20continuously%20increasing.).
And so, [we end up
with](https://twitter.com/samdknowlton/status/1717891196016623956)
certified 'grass-fed' beef where the cattle are fed grass pellets in a
feedlot.

In search of defensible limits with predictable outcomes, regulators
employ tools of [statistical
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing)---but
these calculations
[perpetuate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law)
the accumulation of risk both through their oversimplification of
complex systems and their exclusion of local people.

In fact, the lack of local sensitivity in the implementation of
regulatory limits often
[destabilizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_farmers%27_protests)
the communities institutions intend to protect. In [Sri
Lanka](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/7/15/23218969/sri-lanka-organic-fertilizer-pesticide-agriculture-farming),
for example, a total ban on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides
recently produced unintended food insecurity---sharpening inflation and
political unrest.

### The Ecological Insufficiency of Institutional Limits

It is not just social rejection of institutionally imposed limits that
reduce their viability, as was the case in Sri Lanka. Imposing outside
control over local systems can compound real ecological consequences in
ways that may not be immediately apparent to the institutions that
rendered them.

One such example is the classic story of the removal and reintroduction
of wolves to [Yellowstone National
Park](https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/).
Wolves were once the top predator in the ecosystem, but
by the 1920s they had been effectively exterminated due to federal and
state-sponsored predator control programs aiming to protect
'economically important' livestock and game populations.

It was not until the 1960s that the resulting ecological imbalance
became evident. Elk became overpopulated, overgrazing willow and aspen
stands with ripple effects throughout the region, affecting other
species and leading to a substantial decrease in biodiversity.

After decades of debate, the effort to reintroduce wolves into
Yellowstone began in 1995. This simple step had a cascade effect to the
benefit of the entire local ecosystem. Wolves began to keep the elk
population in check, allowing vegetation to recover. The
recovery of willow stands provided more habitats for beavers, whose dams
create habitats for other species.

Despite the good result, the resource and time intensive process necessary simply to return to what were naturally sustainable ecologies should serve as a warning against the kind of <a href='https://www.institute.global/insights/tech-and-digitalisation/gene-editing-food-production-charting-way-forward'>overzealous</a> institutional influence our home places rely on today.

## Limits Derived in Empathetic Relationship

More sensitive local organizational structures can
[remedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsT9V3WQiNA&t=2638s)
this tendency of industrial economies to produce existential risk.
Instead of accumulating externalities, these structures [match inputs
to
outputs](https://youtu.be/1r8hj72bfGo?si=IY6vaOjTR47AK_rk&t=30)
in [cyclic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6HDcubgxRk)
patterns that conserve energy and reduce external impact. Natural
systems build health---not in their accumulation of resources but in the
quality of active and sustainable relationships.

While our familiar
[linear](https://twitter.com/joshmedia/status/1371232834245914624)
economies hasten destruction as they scale, the nested
[reciprocal](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21836016/)
cycles of healthy forests [build resilience with scale and

By embracing [locally

[non-dissipative](https://youtu.be/Luh7m7YHRts?t=897)
economic systems, we can develop more sustainable communities that also
support broader organizational structures.

### Iteration is Catastrophe's Antidote

Relational organizational structures, with high degrees of [local

[reciprocity](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/7f3g0e/what_is_tequio_traditional_community_labor_in/),

Modern growth-focused methods of placemaking defer debt to the future,
leading to destabilizing [boom and bust
cycles](https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/working-papers/booms-and-busts-in-real-estate/).
This is seen in what has become the norm for master-planned communities,
where thousands of shiny new homes are built all at the same time. While
these communities often start as attractive places to live, over time,
they [face
challenges](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/6/11/levittown-embodied-the-postwar-suburban-experiment-hows-it-doing-now)
as infrastructure ages, design trends change, and initial amenities
become outdated. Natural ecologies, rich in nested cyclic patterns,
instead have a less precarious relationship with time.

Next we will explore a generational way of thinking about our home
places, taking natural ecologies as an example. After that discussion,
we will get into specific technologies that may aid us in maintaining
these more sustainable organizational structures.
