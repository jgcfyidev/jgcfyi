# 1.  Agency & Limits
_For a Generationally Healthy Society_

Empathetic relationships with the people and places around us yield agency bounded by affection. In the absence of healthy relationship, distant institutions attempt control for the sake of moderation but achieve neither, producing only apathy.

While often it is a crisis that awakens us from our listlessness and catalyzes meaningful change, new modes of collective coordination promise pathways for more sustainable propagation of agency.

This is the introductory piece in a series exploring agency and limits as prerequisite to sustainable communities.

{{<quote text="The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place" author="<a href='https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency'>Simon Sarris</a>">}}

[Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(philosophy)) is the capacity to [shape](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6875140-the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world-is-that-it) the world around (and [within](https://twitter.com/cognazor/status/1599097257923514368)) us through action. The presence of this capacity is foundational to a functional society, and its absence today is the cause of many of our collective malformations.

The depletion of the [Aral Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp0Sxn42TGs) stands as one such malformation. Why a bureaucracy of powerful and educated people produced a generations-long environmental and social disaster in the management of the world's fourth largest lake, while traditions of collectively managed irrigation systems have been thriving among uneducated peasants for centuries in [New Mexico](https://newmexiconomad.com/acequias/), [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subak_(irrigation)), [Spain](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comunidad_de_regantes), [Nepal](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-economicsciences2009.pdf) and [India](https://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/pani-panchayat-model-groundwater-management-presentation-acwadam) forms the philosophical basis for our investigation.

## Agency in Context

Although it is [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpBOgh2zxtE) more semiotically convenient to regard agency as a phenomenon of the individual, a rich and enduring state of individual self-determination is only achieved when communities produce it together, for each other.

Just as vital to agency as our _interpersonal_ relationships are our relationships with the physical places we make our lives in. These places existed long before our intervention, and will surely outlast us. At the same time they are, inescapably, an accumulation of their collective communal management up until this point. Only by both attuning ourselves to the unique ecology of our specific place and carrying a deep memory of local traditions of placemaking can we cultivate thriving communities sustainably.

## Agency and Limits

Given our own agency's relationship to people and place over generations, capacity to shape the world does not connote an invitation to limitless consumption, but instead relies on our faculty for [affection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcvJs6RS2Ek) and the extension of trust in and with our [home place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS3-PffLKqM&t=1100s).

As technology broadens our [capacity](https://newdesigncongress.org/en/about#:~:text=now%20work%20as-,accelerants,-%E2%80%93%20exacerbating%20social%2C%20political) to consume, the means by which limits are formed has become more an existential than technical question. It is not that natural limits have been transcended, but that our technology allows us to more easily externalize the effects of our consumption. Part of fostering agency in society, then, relies on our capacity to [conjure our own source of discipline](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/mmt/#:~:text=But%20a%20monetary%20sovereign%20has%20to%20conjure%20its%20own%20source%20of%20discipline.). The means by which we foster these limits are the subject of this series of essays.

### Limits Derived in Institutions

As the [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter#:~:text=as%20Roman%20agricultural,of%20more%20territory.) of our consumption expands, so does the regulatory structure to manage it. Our economic and cultural relationships [produce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) (and are produced by) the [institutions](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=institution%20%E2%80%93%2D%20a%20relationship%20or%20shared%20endeavor%2C%20in%20which%20multiple%20people%20repeatedly%20participate%2C%20and%20featuring%20customs%2C%20rules%2C%20or%20other%20features%20which%20constrain%20or%20motivate%20participants%E2%80%99%20behaviors) that manage them. Because of this relationship, modern limits are most often derived in the postulations of distant institutions, composed of people with more credentials than context. Context is difficult to achieve when the scale of our economies is not in sync with our capacity for affection.

Modern economies and their institutions, despite their obsession with [absorbing data](https://hbr.org/2012/04/good-data-wont-guarantee-good-decisions), [cannot](https://news.gallup.com/poll/403124/majority-continues-say-government-powerful.aspx) produce enough understanding to reason about the limits with meaningful sensitivity to specific places. Institutions that must consider their roles so broadly shape the places they attempt to manage in their own image and at the expense of our individual and community agency.

### Limits Derived in Empathetic Relationship

Small, local economies, with organizational structures informed by generational and empathetic relationships provide a better framework for establishing sustainable limits than institutional decision-makers.

Many great thinkers from [Gandhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1lnK8-PoXQ&t=1695s) to [Wendell Berry](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/thought-limits-prodigal-age) have articulated the existential urgency of grounding society in local relationships. The fidelity of their insight now becomes more evident every year as we search for a society with both agency and the ability to live within limits.

Through the course of this series of essays, we'll work toward an understanding of why new tools for collective coordination may help us approach this vision of local agency with new vigor. With the help of these tools, over time sovereign communities can be scaffolded into a more broadly connected network, more vibrant and less fragile than any more centrally coordinated organizational system, yet still broadly coherent.

Enduring structures of household and family life or the life of a community or the life of a country, cannot be formed except within limits. We must not outdistance local knowledge and affection.

## Agency in Proximity

In these essays, I'll be discussing agency primarily in the context of placemaking. This posture flows out of my previous work in [urban planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_planning#Rational_planning_tradition), but I think it's an appropriate foundation for cultivating a healthy society because our experience of life is so necessarily deeply embedded in the places we make our lives.

Places are uniquely persistent in their effect on culture from generation to generation, more [enduring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Istanbul) than the organizational structures that manage them. Any healthy management of communities, then, must acknowledge the local biophysical reality it exists in.

The fact that our generation's impact on the physical world will outlive us is painfully clear in almost every American city today. The legacy of [gutting downtowns](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8605917/highways-interstate-cities-history) in service of [highways](https://twitter.com/lennartnout/status/1449985513591558144) is something we are still trying to [amend](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/27/climate/us-cities-highway-removal.html) today.

Decisions being made now will [impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsT9V3WQiNA&t=383s) our great grandchildren, and yet most Americans don't have a role to play in building and maintaining their neighborhoods. Since they are so permanent, however, it's time to begin to think more clearly about how to improve the way we make places together over generations.

## Agency and Disengagement

It is [well established](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5002400/) in the fields of psychology and mental health that self-determination and agency are [important factors](https://www.mindful.org/seven-ways-to-develop-personal-agency/#:~:text=People%20with%20low%20agency%20experience,and%20they%20act%20on%20impulse.) in a healthy life. Developed through the maturation of self-efficacy and the extension of trust, agency has even been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3449358/#:~:text=To%20be%20an%20agent%20in,one's%20thoughts%2C%20feelings%20and%20actions.) to correlate with recovery from mental illness. Agency allows individuals to engage more deeply with life in ways that [improve](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dad2.12278)[memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154531/), [mental health](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/discontents), and [resilience](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263111355_Resilience_as_Agency) in the face of challenges. Conversely, without agency [people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5002400/#:~:text=Research%20on%20patients%20with%20schizophrenia%20has%20confirmed%20that%20these%20individuals%20have%20agency%20processing%20problems.)[disengage](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04214-5#:~:text=We%20speculate%20that%20poor%20outcomes%20may%20be%20contributed%20to%20by%20patients%27%20lack%20of%20engagement%20in%20recovery%20due%20to%20poor%20agency%20and%20an%20external%20locus%20of%20control.) from life and are less successful in building healthy and sustainable habits.

This understanding of the [connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5002400/#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20this%20reduction%20in%20sense%20of%20agency%20is%20associated%20with%20poor%20health%20and%20a%20reduction%20in%20quality%20of%20life) between agency and vitality should be carried beyond the individual to communities. A [key marker](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/coercive-control/) of domestic abuse is a [partner](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/from-domination-to-partnership) that reduces their partner's right to self determination, yet we consider a lack of agency in creating our communities to be normal and even [necessary](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=Brennan%20argues%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20entirely%20justifiable%20to%20limit%20the%20political%20power%20that%20the%20irrational%2C%20the%20ignorant%2C%20and%20the%20incompetent%20have%20over%20others.). In the following chapters, I hope to make it clear that capacity for community-based, collective agency and self-determination is vital to the health of neighborhoods, cities, and therefore our society as a whole.

### Experts and Consumers

Generations of [planners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_planners) creating _ **for** _ customers has shifted the perceived malleability of our places. When the value of our places is determined by the application of expert knowledge to meet market demands, rather than by local capacity for interpersonal cooperation, in step with local ecology, we apply a different level of attention and care.

Because of the scale of our economies and the structure of our institutions, the path of least resistance in American culture today is to be a [consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyXfOc0n1LM&t=330s) of place as [product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrG1KgBHdQ&t=585s). Residents are left, at worst, passive speculators on the abilities of experts; or at best, a page in the appendix of a report documenting 'community engagement'. Even our politics invite us to be [spectators](https://behavioralscientist.org/democracy-from-the-sidelines-how-u-s-politics-became-a-spectator-sport/) more often than participants.

{{<quote text="[His] aim was the creation of self-sufficient small towns, really very nice towns if you were docile and had no plans of your own and did not mind spending your life with others with no plans of their own. As in all Utopias, the right to have plans of any significance belonged only to the planner in charge." author="<a href='https://mises.org/library/jane-jacobs-anti-planner#:~:text=Jacobs%20often%20looked,Cities%2C%20p.%2017).'>Jane Jacobs</a>,<i> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities'>The Death and Life of Great American Cities </a></i>">}}

The power to actually change a neighborhood is often reserved for those with [enough money](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2011/6/13/the-growth-ponzi-scheme-part-1.html#:~:text=Put%20these%20two%20characteristics%20together%20and%20you%20have%20a%20key%20insight%3B%20Cities%20routinely%20trade%20near%2Dterm%20cash%20advantages%20associated%20with%20new%20growth%20for%20long%2Dterm%20financial%20obligations%20associated%20with%20maintenance%20of%20infrastructure) or [expertise](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/3/16/have-you-met-this-guy) to wade through bureaucratic marshes of [red tape](https://sf.curbed.com/2016/7/22/12259876/trulia-delays-red-tape-home-prices), or for communities with enough fortitude to fight for years just to force a small compromise in [large organizations](https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/the-federal-government-cares-too-much-about-state-dots-and-thats-a-problem). We consume resources or services (with money earned through [increasingly](https://hbr.org/2011/07/the-big-idea-the-age-of-hyperspecialization)[specialized](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2012/01/31/the-end-of-a-job-as-we-know-it/)[work](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338985197_Specialisation_Vs_Diversification_Which_One_Better_Upholds_Regional_Resilience_to_Economic_Crises#:~:text=found%20that%20more%20diversified%20regional%20economies%20were%20better%20at%20coping%20with%20the%20hardships%20triggered%20by%20the%20recent%20recession)), but are not empowered (culturally or structurally) to build better lives together with our neighbors.

Concentrating power [in this way](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/#:~:text=Here%20is%20the,Utopia%20fail%20horribly) expands the capacity for large-scale change by 'visionaries', but hinders the ability of small actors to act incrementally and responsively to the problems they experience in their own homes and neighborhoods. The problem with this style of central planning is not just that it ends up making inaccurate generalizations about the specific places it manages, but that it lulls those who it plans for into a sleep-like dependence on external authority.

{{<quote text="In further institutionalizing the great power of the majority, we are making the individual come to distrust himself. We are giving him a rationalization for the unconscious urging to find an authority that would resolve the burdens of free choice. We are tempting him to reinterpret the group pressures as a release, authority as freedom." author="William H. Whyte, The Organization Man">}}

### Risks of Disengagement

Over time, not being trusted with community-building has made us [apathetic](https://time.com/6160337/hard-to-care-about-anything/). Engagement in local governance is at an [all time low](https://www.nationalcivicleague.org/ncr-article/increasing-voter-turnout-in-local-elections/#:~:text=The%20turnout%20for%20local%20elections%20is%20historically%20both%20low%20and%20less%20representative%20of%20community%20demographics.). It is now common for people to live without any connection to their [neighbors](https://qz.com/916801/americans-dont-know-their-neighbors-anymore-and-thats-bad-for-the-future-of-democracy), [neighborhoods](https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2017/10/10/don-know-our-neighbors-anymore-here-what-that-costs/m9sTUVbmi3XFfxRN96Ft9M/story.html), or local history. Our habit of [consuming](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/are-we-still-thinking#:~:text=Mass%20media%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8Aprint,have%20conversations%20with.) has rendered us increasingly willing to depend on institutional management of risk, whose expertise we hope can absolve us of any obligation for collaboration, stewardship and affection.

This craving for absolution from choice is no surprise given the well-studied [paradox of choice](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice), which [argues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice) that the glut of choices available to us in modern society is a major source of collective anxiety. Ironically, these systems of institutional abstraction break down local generational memory and tradition, exactly the things that have traditionally produced lighter individual burdens of choice in the past.

The longer our apathetic dependence on distant and opaque systems of organization goes on, the more out of tune we become with traditions of placemaking that have grown alongside the specific ecology of our place. Eventually our collective memory loss can render these traditions unsalvageable.

Critically, sensitivity to local biophysical limits reduces [externalities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290557797_Global_supply_chains_disasters_and_externalities_How_complex_supply_networks_create_damaging_externalities_and_its_consequences) of global supply chains, which through their complexity have become unaccountable to the places they harm the most. As our cultural amnesia becomes more irreversible, our connection with extractive economies shifts from a convenient way to raise standards of living, to a dangerous dependence on fragile [gentrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AckNxh1NZY&t=146s) systems beyond local control.

### Catalysts of Change in a Society Managed at Scale

For most communities defined by numbing, impersonal economies managed by large institutions, the fog of life only [lifts](https://youtu.be/Lf9yoxqt9yw?t=140) when something breaks. Even in a world where we have very little agency, there are some events that remind us how [malleable](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency) the world really can be.

{{<quote text="There is of course the proverbial [office] worker, who is often so inert that he becomes blindsided by a sudden yank of reality (that forces him out of his inertia, and in doing so the story begins)." author="<a href='https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency#:~:text=Beyond%20that%20age%20there%20is%20of%20course%20the%20proverbial%20worker%2C%20in%20modern%20stories%20usually%20an%20office%20worker%2C%20who%20is%20often%20so%20inert%20that%20he%20becomes%20blindsided%20by%20a%20sudden%20yank%20of%20reality%20(that%20forces%20him%20out%20of%20his%20inertia%2C%20and%20in%20doing%20so%20the%20story%20begins).'>Simon Sarris</a>">}}

Shock-events like this provide space to reevaluate and engage with the structure of society, and ultimately prove to be a catalyst of change. Because our institutions and economic relationships haven't yet adapted to these new realities, individuals and small communities realize they suddenly have the ability to offer and implement useful solutions [on their own](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/architectural-community/a8570-tactical-urbanism-and-how-it-complements-participatory-planning/#:~:text=Tactical%20urbanism%20is%20a%20response%20to%20the%20top%2Ddown%2C%20bureaucratic%20approach%20to%20city%20planning%20that%20has%20often%20left%20citizens%20feeling%20powerless%20and%20disconnected%20from%20the%20planning%20process.%20Tactical%20urbanism%20is%20about%20empowering%20people%20to%20take%20control%20of%20their%20own%20city%20planning.).

This [reworking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20303600) of societal structures has been apparent during the period since COVID-19 burst into our lives, inviting changes, not just in [remote working](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508142/), but also [healthcare](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/6921_CHS-Virtual-work/DI_CHS-virtual-work.pdf), [public space](https://crosscut.com/opinion/2021/07/how-pandemic-made-us-rethink-community-spaces), [transportation](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/01/27/study-covid-era-pop-up-bike-lanes-increase-cycling-trips-up-to-48/), [outdoor dining](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/even-post-covid-outdoor-dining-should-keep-going-our-staid-ncna1263352), [supply chains](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rethinking-global-supply-chain-model-by-diane-coyle-2022-06), and more.

This phenomenon can also be observed when only after a [pedestrian death](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/dangerous-by-design/), do communities mobilize to prioritize safe pedestrian infrastructure. In such instances, local [demands for change](https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/06/12/hundreds-march-in-lincoln-square-uptown-to-demand-safer-streets-after-2-toddlers-killed-it-is-evident-that-our-streets-are-not-safe/) become so loud that even a state transportation agency can be moved to action, or citizens take [matters into their own hands](https://ctexaminer.com/2023/01/03/stamford-moves-ahead-with-tactical-urbanism-solutions-for-pedestrian-deaths/). The rise of [tactical urbanism](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/architectural-community/a8570-tactical-urbanism-and-how-it-complements-participatory-planning/#:~:text=Tactical%20urbanism%20is%20a%20response%20to%20the%20top%2Ddown%2C%20bureaucratic%20approach%20to%20city%20planning%20that%20has%20often%20left%20citizens%20feeling%20powerless%20and%20disconnected%20from%20the%20planning%20process.%20Tactical%20urbanism%20is%20about%20empowering%20people%20to%20take%20control%20of%20their%20own%20city%20planning.) and other DIY urbanism are evidence of this impulse.

Large institutions put us at particular risk for these kinds of disruptive events because the formality, bureaucracy, and professional specialization that allow these organizations to function at [scale](https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/7/19/15925506/psychic-numbing-paul-slovic-apathy) are precisely what constitute the disempowering [anesthesia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334225098_The_Apathy_Syndrome_How_We_Are_Trained_Not_to_Care_about_Politics) that induces build up of untended cultural [underbrush](https://www.history.com/news/native-american-wildfires#:~:text=Yosemite%20itself%20was%20routinely%20burned%20to%20clear%20underbrush%2C%20open%20pasture%20lands%2C%20provide%20nutrient%2Drich%20forage%20for%20deer%2C%20and%20to%20support%20the%20growth%20of%20woodland%20food%20crops%20to%20feed%20and%20sustain%20what%20was%20once%20a%20large%20and%20thriving%20Indigenous%20population.).

Often, these '[wake up call](https://www.newsweek.com/near-death-experiences-transform-person-seconds-scientist-1572878)' events, though they may produce positive structural outcomes, more often yield long term damage that is not easy to recover from. I have hope that if we embrace new and empowering models for collaboration and participation, we can solve problems and develop habits of [resilience](https://www.ecosophia.net/the-end-of-the-industrial-age/#:~:text=The%20more%20high%2Dtech%20gimmickry%20you%20can%20do%20without%2C%20and%20the%20more%20you%20rely%20on%20your%20own%20capacities%20instead%20of%20slurping%20at%20an%20assortment%20of%20technological%20teats%2C%20the%20more%20free%20you%20are%20and%20the%20more%20resilience%20you%20have%20in%20the%20face%20of%20the%20future.) that don't require catastrophe to initiate change.

### Where Do We Start?

The study of [wildfires](http://www.pacificbio.org/initiatives/fire/fire_ecology.html) teaches us that building resilient places, protected from catastrophe, requires iterative and ongoing management. Just as [prescribed burns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E542gY7uR0s) are often carried out on foot at a careful pace, we must cultivate smaller scale organizational and economic structures that empower local people to maintain their specific place with care and affection. If we want people to start engaging with the world around them, however, we need to start by giving them real responsibility. Only then can we begin our work to network these local places into a dynamic, resilient whole.

    Agency must be established through the kind of spontaneous, trust-filled relationship that distant institutions are incapable of sustaining. Innovative organizational structures, in rhythm with natural ecologies, can support these relationships in ways that scaffold into a polycentric organizational mycelium.

3. **_Limits_**

    Society can only offer agency predictably if not subjected to the kinds of existential risks of catastrophe introduced by dependence on distant economies and institutions. Affectionate and empathetic relationship with the people and places around us can help more effectively diffuse these risks.

4. **_Agency in the Context of Time and Place_**

    Agency and limits are strongly supported by tradition and generational knowledge transfer, rooted in specific place. Considering cyclic equilibrial investment and draw from generational resources is necessary for a healthy society to be embodied in time and place. This is the long view of building a culture of agency.

5. **_Rooting the Internet in Community and Place_**

    Technologies can work either to take power from small communities, or to give it back. While recent history suggests they have a tendency towards the former, technological innovations have been catalysts for decentralized social organizational change throughout history. New systems of shared value-making on the internet may help us to reverse a technological tendency towards centralization, and deliver vital agency at the local level.

6. **_Digital Tools for Empowered Placemaking_**

    Our experience of life is deeply embedded in our place. New tools for collective action, identity formation, and ownership are poised to shift sovereignty back to small communities at more appropriate fidelity of placemaking.
