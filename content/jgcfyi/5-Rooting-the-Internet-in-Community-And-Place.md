**Rooting the Internet in Community & Place**

_or using tradition as the basis for engaging with technology_

_and progress anchored to the long term fate of a place as an antidote to apathy_

Technologies can work either to take power from small communities, or to give it back. While recent history suggests they have a tendency towards the former, technological innovations have been catalysts for decentralized social organizational change throughout history. **New emerging systems of community coordination may help us to reverse a technological tendency towards centralization** and deliver vital agency at the local level.

_Forget web3/blockchain/crypto/defi/buzz word._

_This is the "Community Computer" revolution._

_Personal Computers unleashed unimaginable levels of sovereignty & interoperability for ppl._

_Community Computers will do the same for groups._

_A blockchain is just a Community Computer._

**Community Computing**

While we [wonder](https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/our-internet/) how to get back to the days of the early internet, before it was controlled by a [handful of corporations](https://hbr.org/2016/06/who-controls-the-internet#:~:text=After%20all%2C%20today%E2%80%99s%20internet%20is%20clearly%20dominated%20by%20what%20Farhad%20Manjoo%2C%20of%20the%20New%20York%20Times%2C%20calls%20the%20Frightful%20Five%3A%20Amazon%2C%20Apple%2C%20Facebook%2C%20Google%20(now%20a%20unit%20of%20Alphabet)%2C%20and%20Microsoft.), we forget that early versions of the public internet originated in [local](https://spectrum.ieee.org/social-medias-dialup-ancestor-the-bulletin-board-system)[interpersonal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I18ifd8I6P8&t=546s) networks.

Early bulletin board systems (BBS) needed a [specific individual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system#The_first_BBSes:~:text=placed%20at%20his%20house%20in%20Chicago%20where%20it%20would%20be%20a%20local%20phone%20call%20for%20more%20users) to host them, and many of their communities met in person regularly. Networks of BBSs like [Fidonet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) even created protocols for interrelation of small communities remarkably similar to the polycentric organizational structures we discussed in Chapter 2.

For Internet users today, there is more to the BBS story than mere nostalgia. As our online lives are channeled through an ever-smaller number of service providers, reflecting on the long-forgotten dial-up era can open our eyes to the value of diversity and local control. - [Kevin Driscoll](https://spectrum.ieee.org/social-medias-dialup-ancestor-the-bulletin-board-system#:~:text=For%20Internet%20users%20today%2C%20there%20is%20more%20to%20the%20BBS%20story%20than%20mere%20nostalgia.%20As%20our%20online%20lives%20are%20channeled%20through%20an%20ever%2Dsmaller%20number%20of%20service%20providers%2C%20reflecting%20on%20the%20long%2Dforgotten%20dial%2Dup%20era%20can%20open%20our%20eyes%20to%20the%20value%20of%20diversity%20and%20local%20control)

Technologies that help us re-root the internet in community and place may be the pathway back to a more human internet, one that can produce more sustainable places. The category of emerging technologies that include the terms 'crypto', '[public ledgers](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-cryptocurrency-public-ledger/)', blockchains, and 'web3' will be our focus in this chapter, as it is my opinion that they have the most potential to open these new pathways of consequential collaboration on the internet.

While 'crypto' is the most common term for this class of technologies, [cryptographic building blocks](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=Digression%3A%20The%20%E2%80%9Ccrypto%E2%80%9D%20in%20crypto) have been powering our relationships on the internet [since its beginning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cryptography#Cryptography_politics), including simple encryption. Other recent technological breakthroughs beyond crypto, including [zero-knowledge proofs](https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/#:~:text=Further%20reading-,What%20are%20zero%2Dknowledge%20proofs%3F,responsible%20for%20validating%20the%20claim.) and artificial intelligence, promise broad shifts in how we interact on the internet and in our physical communities.

In this chapter I'll try to use plain ([if uncommon](https://web.archive.org/web/20221102211912/https://nikolai.fyi/purple/#sec-1-3)) language instead of terms like 'crypto', not only for the sake of those who are unfamiliar with the technologies and the language of '[crypto twitter](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/getting-started-with-crypto-twitter/)' but also because many crypto people have been made [cynics](https://milkyeggs.com/crypto/the-doomer-case-for-the-final-death-of-crypto/) by recent failures of its culture to produce worthwhile tools. Thinking in terms of 'community computing' can help us [lift our collective gaze](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/communal-computing/) to what is possible with these technologies beyond the [many failures](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story-FTX-collapse-matt-levine) we see today.

Ironically, much of what has been written about the ability of community computing to build local agency has comefrom the many [venture capitalists](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402) (a different kind of [large](https://a16zcrypto.com/#:~:text=%244.5%20billion%20fourth%20fund%2C%20bringing%20our%20total%20funds%20raised%20to%20more%20than%20%247.6%20billion) institution) looking to make money from their salesmanship [rather](https://twitter.com/delete_shitcoin/status/1569682809932976128) than an ability to build meaningful new tools. The sort of gold rush that has happened in the world of crypto has attracted some unsavory characters and resulted in often extremely [negative public opinions](https://mheadd.medium.com/on-zealotry-and-cryptocurrency-b92bbab61bf7), many of them [well-founded](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=Just%20kidding%3A%20They%E2%80%99ll%20be%20owned%20by%20venture%20capitalists%20who%20buy%20tokens%20in%20these%20projects%20early%20on%20and%20who%20are%20the%20biggest%20boosters%20of%20web3.).

Still, I hope to help you [look beyond](https://www.fwb.help/editorial/after-crypto-yancey-strickler-metalabel) the opportunists and pessimists to see that there is [something material](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-im-less-than-infinitely-hostile) and substantial about these emerging technologies that can help us claim more agency from centralizing forces that have eroded community health and local [generational memory](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/06/internet-giving-us-shorter-attention-spans-worse-memories-major/) over the past century.

While many recent technologies have made us more reliant on centralized institutions and decidedly non-local supply chains, not all technologies build dependence on industrial patterns of organization. There are also those technologies that build local resilience. EF Schumacher and Ivan Illich were thinking about these [intermediate technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology) and [tools for conviviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality) already in the 1970s.

Just as the [printing press](https://www.history.com/news/printing-press-renaissance) distributed the power of knowledge once centralized in religious institutions and the [internet](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=109868) distributed the power of voice once centralized in media institutions, tools of crypto have the potential to distribute the power of money and other systems of value management now with high degrees of centralized risk. One [federal bank](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/economy/federal-reserve-global-fallout.html) deciding the [fate of the world](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1605413877985968128) economy is not how value worked [historically](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/properties-of-money/#:~:text=For%20a%20phenomenal%20review%20of%20money%E2%80%99s%20historical%20plurality%2C%20see%20Akinobu%20Kuroda%E2%80%99s%20A%20Global%20History%20of%20Money.), and it is likely not a permanent or healthy current feature of our global economic system. Crypto goes far beyond money as well, with the possibility to remake systems of record-keeping independent of states.

If you've read the previous installments of this series, it should be clear that I don't think [technology](https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1596918140545691652) can solve all the problems we face today. Healthy society depends primarily on our ability to form relationships with our neighbors and the places we live over generations. I do think, though, that we can use technology to further those endeavors.

I won't do any more qualifying since I've also already devoted a whole list of general notes on the philosophy of my writing here. Below I'll discuss the historical precedent for technologies of disintermediation and then discuss what new opportunities we have today to make our society more healthy in the tradition of these precedents.

_A Note on Infrastructure_

While we still have a great deal of [dependence](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/08/77139/) on centrally managed [physical infrastructure](https://cip.gmu.edu/2016/10/26/understanding-physical-internet-infrastructure-vulnerabilities/#:~:text=the%20existence%20of%20a%20single%20physical%20structure%20that%20houses%20so%20many%20important%20connections%20represents%20a%20vulnerability%20with%20the%20potential%20for%20serious%20cascading%20consequences%20for%20global%20Internet%20routing.) for internet connectivity today, physical [peer-to-peer infrastructure](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Main_Page) such as [mesh networks](https://urbanomnibus.net/2019/10/building-the-peoples-internet/) can and must be a necessary [synergistic companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) to the kinds of tools for decentralized (digital) organizational infrastructure discussed in this chapter. We cannot have communities with agency if they do not have [agency over their tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_clFVHKS2g) for organization, and the [tools](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/from-domination-to-partnership#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20not%20that%20people%20are%20incapable%20of%20collaboration%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20just%20that%20most%20of%20us%20lack%20tools%2C%20skills%20and%20role%20models) themselves play a part in imparting agency.

_A Note on Digital Agency_

The [erosion](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1503822879552688129) of opportunities for building agency in the physical world has led some to pursue [digital-first sovereignty](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1547851370924892161). I [acknowledge](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1548028452355182593) that [sometimes](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency#:~:text=(There%20are%20good,Start%20typing.)) digital agency is the only path to agency people have available.

However, I am [doubtful](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1548028447561134090)[this approach](https://thenetworkstate.com/) can lead to healthy communities with agency. Digital tools can be powerful for scratching our natural itch for agency, but they should be anchored in a physical reality to avoid [manipulation](https://towardsdatascience.com/algorithmic-behavior-modification-by-big-tech-is-crippling-academic-data-science-research-c600d4fe696b) and dependency. The physical world is vital to our existence and the health of a community depends on the physical health of its people. Without a relationship to the physical world, any prospect of digital agency is at best precarious and at worst illusory.

**A History of Societal Change Spurred by Technology**

While the most immediate example to us, the internet isn't the first technology to challenge the legitimacy of presiding institutions. These kinds of technology-based organizational transitions have been taking place throughout history, and will be useful in understanding what opportunities for societal innovation we may have in the internet and community computers. These thoughts are based on some fantastic resources from [Ethan Buchman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9C1Y89Txdw), [Jon Hillis](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8), and [Josh Rosenthal](https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-the-crypto-renaissance-josh-rosenthal-e35) (among many others).

[https://twitter.com/Narodism/status/1592226566951559169](https://twitter.com/Narodism/status/1592226566951559169)

Historians have noticed a [common](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/communal-computing/#:~:text=In%20design%2C%20there%20is%20a%20technique%20diverge%2Dconverge)[cycle](https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/617161) of decentralization and re-centralization associated with social technological leaps in the past. Technologies that enable new ways of coordinating catch on quickly at the interpersonal level, injecting energy, engagement, and even [solidarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah) into organizational structures.

Incumbent (and more centralized) institutions can't keep up with these new organic structures, so the process is naturally decentralizing. New and remade institutions attempt to stabilize and scale the once decentralized and interpersonal movement, at the sake of local agency. In the institutional representation, process supersedes local sensitivity and relationship, and the 'efficient' institution is unable to represent the diversity of its constituents. The scaled organizational structure eventually begins to feel the dead weight of its overextended borders. This structural weakness is often met again by new social technologies or other catalysts for change when the time is right.

Some examples of social technologies that were [catalysts](https://dark.fi/insights/ftx-where-next.html#:~:text=Evolution%20is%20not%20a%20steady%20progression%20of%20mechanical%20optimizations.%20It%20is%20more%20like%20an%20orchestra.%20Periods%20of%20sombre%20stability%20and%20balance%20are%20punctuated%20by%20incredibly%20violent%20but%20short%20episodes%20of%20change.) for [cultural phase transition](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/35#c1:~:text=A%20new%20study%20suggests%20that%20this%20process%20involves%20a%20kind%20of%20phase%20transition%20in%20which%20the%20%E2%80%9Cdeep%20structure%E2%80%9D%20of%20a%20language%20crystallizes%20out%20abruptly%20as%20grammar%20rules%20are%20intuited%20by%20the%20learner.) include:

**Physical Changes by Digital Means**

From the [birth of agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_city#cite_note-1:~:text=The%20Neolithic%20revolution%20brought%20agriculture%2C%20which%20made%20denser%20human%20populations%20possible%2C%20thereby%20supporting%20city%20development.) to the [industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_city#Industrial_revolution), technologies have always influenced physical communities. Maybe the most obvious for us today is the ways in which [transportation technology](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-29/the-commuting-principle-that-shaped-urban-history)[shapes cities](https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter8/transportation-urban-form/evolution-transport-urban-form/). Depending on their periods of highest growth, cities have been built around walking and bodies of water, then street cars and early transit, and then cars. Today remote work can be viewed as a new technological shift affecting the city form, this time not ushered by physical transportation but by the mobility of communication afforded by the internet.

The internet has had a profound effect on our daily lives in recent decades, far beyond recent trends of remote work. Today, an increasing number of people spend [more](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/)[time](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-time-spent-with-connected-tech) on the internet than being physically present. But the internet is not just a retreat from the physical, it shapes the way we make our physical communities, with greater internet connectivity [moving](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/business/the-internet-as-an-influence-on-urbanization.html#:~:text=But%20to%20date%2C%20the%20impact%20of%20the%20Internet%20has%20been%20mainly%20to%20reinforce%20the%20economic%20and%20intellectual%20leadership%20of%20a%20handful%20of%20urban%20centers%20and%20nearby%20suburbs%2C%20according%20to%20an%20analysis%20by%20the%20Taub%20Urban%20Research%20Center%20at%20New%20York%20University.) less dense urban regions towards greater [physical](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248982) and [local-social](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2001/11/20/the-internet-cities-and-social-capital/)[cohesion](https://www.uh.edu/~kohlhase/CraigHoangKohlhase_internet_WP_Oct_2014.pdf) over time. Understanding how the iterations of the internet has and will impact our physical world, we can also [dream](https://pluriverse.world/) how we can make physical communities more resilient with a more empowered internet.

I'm [not the first](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4954/3786) person to suggest that digital tools can help solve physical problems in cities, but I do want to specifically discuss the ways that new internet-based tools will impact collective coordination by more deeply engaging and empowering small groups of people to shape their immediate surroundings.

It's not that people are incapable of collaboration, it's just that most of us lack tools - [Richard D. Bartlett](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/from-domination-to-partnership)

Relational modes of sharing and transferring value, like [cooperatives](https://cultivate.coop/wiki/Films_and_Videos_on_Cooperatives), are often more organizationally burdensome today than "typical" market-based economics. Elinor Ostrom recognized the 'tragedy of the commons' in [common pool resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource) to often be a problem of coordination, [saying](https://youtu.be/T6OgRki5SgM?t=2216): "we found that groups that did not communicate were more likely to overuse their resources … But all we had to do was to introduce the possibility of face to face communication, and that allowed them to increase cooperation." When allowed to cooperate to design systems of managing common pool resources, local people often [outperform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6OgRki5SgM&t=1779s) institutional intervention. New tools of [agentic coordination](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/communal-computing/#:~:text=of%20the%20internet%3F-,Agentic%20software,-embodies%20a%20Hundertwasser) can help support broader adoption of these old ideas, but only if they are [sufficiently learnable](https://venkatesh-rao.gitbook.io/summer-of-protocols/#_ozkudrau5sjb) to a broad enough demographic.

We must make it possible for the average layperson to be able to change and adapt software for their own needs; for them to experience creating software not like a professional chef, but a home cook.

- Jacky Zhao, [_Communal Computing Networks_](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/communal-computing/#:~:text=We%20must%20make%20it%20possible%20for%20the%20average%20layperson%20to%20be%20able%20to%20change%20and%20adapt%20software%20for%20their%20own%20needs%3B%20for%20them%20to%20experience%20creating%20software%20not%20like%20a%20professional%20chef%2C%20but%20a%20home%20cook.)

Community computers and other collaborative technologies can support movements like [cosmolocalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_localism) to help build the digital commons that serves as common knowledge-sharing infrastructure and toolset for local places to thrive and improve local coordination and physical production.

This kind of coordination can be fun and intuitive, and has yielded local collaboration for production of everything from [industrial machinery](https://www.opensourceecology.org/) and 3D printed [guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlB2QV5wVxg) to [frog houses](https://twitter.com/Brieyonce/status/1630051041524760576?s=20) and [park benches](https://www.betterblock.org/wikiblock). If given more agency in placemaking, I picture a world where empowered people share knowledge to make home building and [other forms](http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/) of physical community building more collaborative and spontaneous as well.

**Practically Speaking…. So What?**

I concede that theoretical possibilities of change do not imply certainty of change. Just because technologies have changed specific places in the past does not mean community computing will do that in the future. There is a real possibility that the disruptive nature of these technologies, combined with their open nature (they may also empower illegal activities) means that development of these social systems continues, but has to do so in the [shadows](https://dark.fi/manifesto.html) as regulatory oversight becomes burdensome. In the end, these systems may only provide an escape valve from the most oppressive of states [rather than a broad social movement](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1598051030117552131) that moves small communities in many places forward.

Despite these uncertainties, these technologies [already are being used today](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html#:~:text=Over%20the%20past,cities%20from%20scratch.) in small ways that could pave the way for meaningful cultural change. I'll get into some specific examples in our final chapter, but first I'd like to define the spirit of the technology we're discussing a bit more specifically.

**Defining an 'Empowered Internet'**

There is already a parallel internet being built by groups and individuals looking for an oasis from the irrelational scale and surveillance made possible by the modern internet. In the 90s, these people were a small group called [cypherpunks](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html). These are the forefathers of bitcoin and what is today called [crypto](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/). Because of the open nature of the internet, and the implications of involving money so closely with political ideology and conviction, opinions on what 'crypto' even is today vary greatly. I won't try to form some all-encompassing definition, but would like to identify some key cultural touchstones that will help [contextualize](https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0#:~:text=Understanding%20blockchains%20as%20a%20source%20of%20hardness%20also%20helps%20us%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20dizzying%20array%20of%20narratives%20and%20buzzwords%20that%20have%20been%20used%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20them%20over%20time%3A) how these technologies apply to local relational economies. (If you are looking for an intro to crypto in general, I suggest [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/) piece by Matt Levine)

Cypherpunk philosophy is fundamentally about leveraging this precious asymmetry to create a world that better preserves the autonomy of the individual, and cryptoeconomics is to some extent an extension of that, except this time protecting the safety and liveness of complex systems of coordination and collaboration, rather than simply the integrity and confidentiality of private messages.

- Vitalik Buterin, [_A Proof of Stake Design Philosophy_](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51#:~:text=Cypherpunk%20philosophy%20is,of%20private%20messages)

_Digital Sovereignty and Resilience_

Digital sovereignty is perhaps the most basic pursuit of these technologies, meaning the right of individuals and communities to exist on the internet without interference. These principles are tightly tied with [privacy](https://safecomputing.umich.edu/privacy/history-of-privacy-timeline), since a lack of privacy can result in altered behavior, through fearful self-censorship or in response to intervention by surveilling institutions, of which the internet has a [long tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Lantern_(software)) of.

Distributed systems that grant sovereignty and privacy by default to individuals make surveillance harder for states. What they give up in [control](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2022/6/29/local-control-or-centralized-planning-theres-a-third-answer#:~:text=And%20the%20latter%2C%20perhaps%20paradoxically%2C%20requires%20relinquishing%20some%20control%20and%20tolerating%20a%20little%20more%20chaos), though, is gained in resilience by allowing citizens to engage more deeply in maintaining their own tools and cultures themselves.

_Empowered Participation Through Direct Ownership_

Throughout most of human history, people were compelled to engage deeply with the place around them, the land and their neighbors, because it was their only option. Today the path of least resistance is outsourcing all home or place-making activities in exchange for money.

Even local governments often use outside [consultants](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/industries/government-public-services.html?icid=top_government-public-services) to accomplish most of their work. Community computing networks allow people to build tools where they can own and actively participate in the important services they rely on rather than paying a 'specialist' outside the community. This infrastructure provides a more relational and engaging path to community management.

_Composability & Openness_

For many examples of possible uses of community computing, often the question is asked pointedly, "[why does this need to be on a blockchain](https://blockchainforgov.org/)?" One of those reasons is that distributed protocols lend native [composability](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/). This means that infrastructure can be integrated together, bringing tools in relationship. This is crucial for networks that allow payment, voting, and identity solutions because each new tool benefits the others. These open maps of relationships, when combined with appropriate privacy considerations, can produce new kinds of [collaborative](https://cofi.informal.systems/) synergistic relationships that are impossible to achieve in a world of [intellectual proprietarianism](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Beyond_Foucault_Excursions_in_Political/o4hyDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA121&printsec=frontcover).

In order to see spontaneous and creative growth, we need credibly neutral platforms on which to build, with low barriers for creation, something that you can trust to build on – there are parallels to cities, where people know they are dependent on developers and the city, who may change rules … and so there is no incentive for spontaneous creativity.

_Social Scalability_

Nick Szabo pioneered the argument that blockchains allow institutions to scale beyond what is typically locally and socially viable through traditional means, calling this [social scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=Social%20scalability%20is,can%20successfully%20participate.). Many of the failures of today's institutions are not necessarily because they are _too large_, but that the technology and organizational structures they are built on are no longer able to remain sensitive to interpersonal relationship at their current scale. Some advocates argue that blockchains can remake standards of relating at scale that universally allow anyone to participate, but in a way that more fully guarantees sensitivity and spontaneity at the local level.

The number and variety of people who can successfully participate in an online institution is far less often restricted by the objective limits of computers and networks than it is by limitations of mind and institution that have not yet been sufficiently redesigned or further evolved to take advantage of those technological improvements.

**Cultural Diversity in Crypto**

While open systems can create the right conditions for agency, there is the [tendency](https://theblockchainsocialist.com/talking-politics-with-vitalik-buterin-part-2/) in the world of crypto to design cultural discretion away in order to make these systems ready for any level of [adversity](https://bank.dev/why#:~:text=Understanding%20that%20every%20theoretical%20incentive%20incompatability%20is%20guaranteed%20to%20be%20exploited.). Systems like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) are designed in an open way in order to accommodate general purpose use with no need for social context or permission. The ability to make permanent, uncensorable tools is important, but so is the ability to have [stewardable](https://venkatesh-rao.gitbook.io/summer-of-protocols/#_1znhggknfsxb), [socially responsive technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyaWFicSihE). In her [research](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-economicsciences2009.pdf), Elinor Ostrom found that locally maintained systems often work better than 'superior' engineered solutions because the former are maintained with active engagement. Permanent systems designed without the need for maintenance are susceptible to disuse and disengagement.

This tension between the universal accessibility of formal and rigid systems and the invitation to local spontaneous engagement potentiated by informal systems has been the subject of debates that have emerged in the communities of [Ethereum](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=i.-,Ethereum,-The%20computer%20that) and [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/). Ethereum is [best](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1540427123839713280) when it functions as an [immutable](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=i.-,Censorship%20resistance,-Ordinarily%2C%20if%20there%E2%80%99s) and permanent source of 'universal' truth. This helps make tools composable and interoperable, over time building a robust web of resilient (independently maintained) infrastructure. On the other hand, [Cosmos](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1330600018777157633) (and future infrastructure like [Celestia](https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1548345842431455236)) provide localsovereignty at the community level, with more degrees of freedom in designing how to build and maintain social consensus.

Together, these new foundations can help forge pathways of agency, where specific empowered communities maintain locally sensitive community computing systems alongside universally available and reliable digital infrastructure in order to build strong local resilience and memory over generations. In the following chapter, we'll look more closely at the specific ways I expect these technologies to be employed most powerfully in the coming years.
