A healthy society is built on relationship, between people and to their
home places over time. Our tools can either support or undermine this
delicate balance.

## Technology in Place

The internet has been the defining tool of the past century. While it
appears today as a force of abstraction and disembodiment, controlled by
a [handful of
corporations](https://hbr.org/2016/06/who-controls-the-internet#:~:text=After%20all%2C%20today%E2%80%99s%20internet%20is%20clearly%20dominated%20by%20what%20Farhad%20Manjoo%2C%20of%20the%20New%20York%20Times%2C%20calls%20the%20Frightful%20Five%3A%20Amazon%2C%20Apple%2C%20Facebook%2C%20Google%20(now%20a%20unit%20of%20Alphabet)%2C%20and%20Microsoft.)---we
often forget that the first versions of the public internet originated
in
[local](https://spectrum.ieee.org/social-medias-dialup-ancestor-the-bulletin-board-system)
[interpersonal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I18ifd8I6P8&t=546s)
relationship.

Early bulletin board systems (BBS) were hosted in members'
[homes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system#The_first_BBSes:~:text=placed%20at%20his%20house%20in%20Chicago%20where%20it%20would%20be%20a%20local%20phone%20call%20for%20more%20users),
many of whom also met in person regularly. The first BBS was called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Memory" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Community Memory</a>', a [remarkably
appropriate](https://www.are.na/blog/community-memory#:~:text=the%20project%20might%20serve%20as%20a%20model%20for%20how%20we%20can%20shape%20the%20web%20and%20technology%20around%20our%20mutual%20needs%20and%20desires%20as%20communities%20rooted%20in%20place.)
descriptor of what we have been discussing. Networks of BBSs like
[Fidonet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) even
created protocols for interrelation of small communities notably similar
to the polycentric organizational structures we discussed in Chapter 2.

A return to
[technologies](https://twitter.com/TBSocialist/status/1596918140545691652)
that help ground us in community and place may be the pathway back to
both a more human internet and more sustainable places with coherent
community memory.

EF Schumacher and Ivan Illich were already thinking about these '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>appropriate technologies</a>'
and '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>tools for conviviality</a>'
in the 1970s. Ongoing small-scale
[experiments](https://iffybooks.net/wp-content/uploads/zines/Iffy_Books_Pocket_Wifi_Portal_Zine_print.pdf)
in place-based relationality like
[Appropedia](https://www.appropedia.org/Welcome_to_Appropedia)
have continued to allow the curious to scratch an itch for local
sovereignty---but the time is now right for a broader revolution in our
local placemaking.

### Crypto, In Context

Recent breakthroughs in [artificial
intelligence](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/25/1177700852/ai-future-dangers-benefits)
promise broad societal changes---but despite its skeptics, the category
of emerging technologies that includes the terms 'crypto', '<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-cryptocurrency-public-ledger/" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>public ledgers</a>',
blockchains, and 'web3' may be opening the most exciting new pathways
for distributing (instead of
[consolidating](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/27/openai-microsoft-big-tech-monopoly))
power toward more resilient home places, in the lineage of BBSs.

This essay seeks to put these emerging tools for collaboration in their
historical and social context. It won't try to form some
[all-encompassing
survey](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/)
of the many corners of crypto, but instead will identify some of its
core cultural
[principles](https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0)
as they relate to affectionate economies, rooted in their place. The
concluding piece in the series will more deeply explore near term
applications in our physical communities.

## Societal Change Spurred by Technology

Just as the [printing
press](https://www.history.com/news/printing-press-renaissance)
distributed the power of knowledge once centralized in religious
institutions and the
[internet](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=109868)
distributed the power of voice once centralized in media institutions,
new tools for community computing have the potential to distribute the
power of money and other systems of value management now with high
degrees of centralized risk. One [federal
bank](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/economy/federal-reserve-global-fallout.html)
deciding the [fate of the
world](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis/status/1605413877985968128)
economy is not how value worked
[historically](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/properties-of-money/#:~:text=For%20a%20phenomenal%20review%20of%20money%E2%80%99s%20historical%20plurality%2C%20see%20Akinobu%20Kuroda%E2%80%99s%20A%20Global%20History%20of%20Money.),
and it is likely not a healthy or permanent feature of our global
economic system. These tools go far beyond money as well, with the
possibility to reclaim systems of maintaining our places, independent of
[helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent)
states.

### Cycles of Centralization and Decentralization 

The internet isn't the first technology to challenge the legitimacy of
presiding institutions (or to give way to new institutions). Keen
observers have noticed a common
[cycle](https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/617161)
of decentralization and re-centralization associated with social
technological leaps throughout history. In this pattern, technologies
that enable new ways of coordinating catch on quickly at the
interpersonal level, injecting energy, engagement, and even
[solidarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah) into
organizational structures.

Incumbent (and more centralized) institutions struggle to keep pace with
these emerging organic structures, so the process is naturally
decentralizing. As new and remade institutions attempt to stabilize and
scale the movement, process begins to supersede local sensitivity. This
'efficient' institution is again unable to represent the diversity of
its constituents, and the organizational structure begins to feel the
weight of its overextended borders. When the time is right, the
resulting structural weakness is often exposed and challenged by new
social technologies or other catalysts for change.

While this model fits the evolution of the internet itself, some other
examples of social technologies that were
[catalysts](https://dark.fi/insights/ftx-where-next.html#:~:text=Evolution%20is%20not%20a%20steady%20progression%20of%20mechanical%20optimizations.%20It%20is%20more%20like%20an%20orchestra.%20Periods%20of%20sombre%20stability%20and%20balance%20are%20punctuated%20by%20incredibly%20violent%20but%20short%20episodes%20of%20change.)
for [cultural phase

    and [market

    which led to [federations and

    which greatly "increased the power, leverage, velocity,
    composability and granularity of money"

These thoughts are based on some fantastic resources from [Ethan

Hillis](https://creators.mirror.xyz/s9h4_PQAcJyqgC0rnsWjw9geU2wJs-IBPXIzHhgi-P8),

Rosenthal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=karddOiv4ZA)
(among others). I encourage you to dig into what they have to say if you
have any interest.

### Physical Changes by Digital Means

Of course, it's not just culture and institutions that are changed by
new tools. From the [birth of
agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cities#Origins)
to the [industrial
revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_city#Industrial_revolution)
and the [advent of the
automobile](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-29/the-commuting-principle-that-shaped-urban-history),
our technologies have always influenced our places. And so, as an
increasing number of people spend
[more](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/)
[time](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-time-spent-with-connected-tech)
online than being physically present, the internet represents not just a
retreat from the physical, but a strong influence on the shape of our
places. Today we have seen greater internet connectivity
[move](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/business/the-internet-as-an-influence-on-urbanization.html#:~:text=But%20to%20date%2C%20the%20impact%20of%20the%20Internet%20has%20been%20mainly%20to%20reinforce%20the%20economic%20and%20intellectual%20leadership%20of%20a%20handful%20of%20urban%20centers%20and%20nearby%20suburbs%2C%20according%20to%20an%20analysis%20by%20the%20Taub%20Urban%20Research%20Center%20at%20New%20York%20University.)
less dense urban regions towards greater
[physical](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248982)
and
[local-social](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2001/11/20/the-internet-cities-and-social-capital/)
[cohesion](https://www.uh.edu/~kohlhase/CraigHoangKohlhase_internet_WP_Oct_2014.pdf)
over time and remote work change our relationship with in-person
coordination altogether.

Understanding how the internet has and might impact our physical world,
we can also [dream](https://pluriverse.world/) how we can
make physical communities more resilient with a [more empowered
internet](https://publicinfrastructure.org/about/). In
particular, we can look forward to how new internet-based tools will
impact [collective
coordination](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4954/3786)
by more deeply engaging and empowering small groups of people to shape
their immediate surroundings.

## New Tools for Collaborative Coordination

Relational modes of sharing and transferring value, like
[cooperatives](https://web.archive.org/web/20230120041930/https://cultivate.coop/wiki/Films_and_Videos_on_Cooperatives),
are often more organizationally burdensome today than conventional
market-based economies. Time and energy spent cultivating personal and
economic relationship is simply more difficult in a society that has
replaced interpersonal trust with Amazon reviews.

Elinor Ostrom recognized the 'tragedy of the commons' in [common pool
resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource)
to often be a problem of coordination,
[saying](https://youtu.be/T6OgRki5SgM?t=2216), "All we had
to do was to introduce the possibility of face-to-face communication,
and that allowed \[groups\] to increase cooperation." When allowed to
cooperate to design systems for managing common pool resources, local
people often
[outperform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6OgRki5SgM&t=1779s)
institutional intervention. And so, new tools for collaborative
coordination can simplify the path toward local capacity for
interrelation and mutual affection.

> It's not that people are incapable of collaboration, it's just that
> most of us lack tools

> --- [Richard D.
> Bartlett](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/from-domination-to-partnership#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20not%20that%20people%20are%20incapable%20of%20collaboration%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20just%20that%20most%20of%20us%20lack%20tools)

Despite the promise of being more effective and empowering, it is
crucial that [new tools](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/agentic-computing/) for the
coordination of self sovereign communities be [sufficiently
learnable](https://venkatesh-rao.gitbook.io/summer-of-protocols/#_ozkudrau5sjb)
by a broad enough demographic, otherwise they risk becoming
infrastructure for the same kind of
[intermediaries](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/05/the-defi-mullet/)
we rely on today to coordinate our economies. If made accessible,
community computers and other collaborative technologies can mature
knowledge sharing aspirations present in organizations like
[makerspaces](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/257/)
and cooperatives to help them compete with legacy economic
relationships.

Such digital coordination can be fun and intuitive---and has yielded
collaborative design and production of everything from [industrial
machinery](https://www.opensourceecology.org/) and
[scientific
processes](https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1686388841287168000?s=20)

digital [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)
can enable key functions of physical placemaking---making home-building
and transportation infrastructure more relational,
[spontaneous](http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/), and fun.

## Defining an 'Empowered Internet' 

People seeking
[refuge](https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/our-internet/)
from the industrial scale and surveillance of the modern internet are
advocating for a retreat to what is being called the ‘<a href="https://notes.alexkehayias.com/the-cozy-web/">cozy web</a>’. The
concept represents a more private and interpersonal [oasis of digital
relatedness](https://publicinfrastructure.org/2023/03/29/the-three-legged-stool/).

This desire for online autonomy isn\'t new. Privacy enabling
[cryptography](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=Digression%3A%20The%20%E2%80%9Ccrypto%E2%80%9D%20in%20crypto)
has been powering our relationships on the internet [since its
beginning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cryptography#Cryptography_politics)
(and
[before](https://summerofprotocols.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/53-BEIKO-001-2023-12-13.pdf)).
[Cypherpunks](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)
were [fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars)
for digital privacy and freedom already in the 90s, and their efforts
helped pave the way for digital currency systems independent of state
control. This movement began with Bitcoin in 2008 and today is called
[crypto](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/).
Bitcoin first was an attempt to subvert institutional power, but crypto
has become home to a much wider range of ideologies.

### Caveats and Uncertainties

Ironically, much of what has been written about the ability of these
technologies to build local agency has come from the many [venture
capitalists](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402)
(a different kind of
[large](https://web.archive.org/web/20230107093836/https://a16zcrypto.com/#:~:text=a16z%20crypto%20is%20a%20venture%20capital%20fund%20that%20invests%20in%20crypto%20and%20web3%20startups.%20We%20recently%20announced%20a%20%244.5%20billion%20fourth%20fund%2C%20bringing%20our%20total%20funds%20raised%20to%20more%20than%20%247.6%20billion.)
institution) looking to make money from their salesmanship
[rather](https://twitter.com/delete_shitcoin/status/1569682809932976128)
than an ability to build meaningful new tools. This kind of gold rush in
the world of crypto has attracted some [unsavory
characters](https://cryptobriefing.com/the-top-10-crypto-villains-2022/)
and resulted in often extremely [negative public
opinions](https://mheadd.medium.com/on-zealotry-and-cryptocurrency-b92bbab61bf7),
many
[well-founded](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=Just%20kidding%3A%20They%E2%80%99ll%20be%20owned%20by%20venture%20capitalists%20who%20buy%20tokens%20in%20these%20projects%20early%20on%20and%20who%20are%20the%20biggest%20boosters%20of%20web3.).

What\'s more, the disruptive and open nature of these technologies means
that the development of these social systems may only continue in the
[shadows](https://dark.fi/manifesto.html) as regulatory
oversight becomes burdensome. In the end, these systems may only provide
an [escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlB2QV5wVxg)
from the most oppressive of states [rather than a broad social
movement](https://twitter.com/0xJim/status/1598051030117552131)
that moves small communities in all places forward.

Still, I hope to help you [look
beyond](https://www.fwb.help/editorial/after-crypto-yancey-strickler-metalabel)
the opportunists and pessimism to see that there is [something
material](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-im-less-than-infinitely-hostile)
and substantial about these emerging technologies that can help us claim
more agency from centralizing forces that have eroded community health
and local [generational
memory](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/06/internet-giving-us-shorter-attention-spans-worse-memories-major/)
over the past century.

Despite these uncertainties, community computers [are already being
used](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/10/31/cities.html#:~:text=We%27re%20even%20seeing%20projects%20with%20varying%20degrees%20of%20radicalness%20%2D%20Cul%20de%20sac%2C%20Telosa%2C%20CityDAO%2C%20Nkwashi%2C%20Prospera%20and%20many%20more%20%2D%20trying%20to%20create%20entire%20neighborhoods%20and%20cities%20from%20scratch.)
to improve places in small ways today. We'll get into some specific
examples in our final chapter, but first let\'s engage with the spirit
of the budding technological tradition we're discussing.

### Digital Sovereignty and Resilience

Digital sovereignty is perhaps the most basic pursuit of these
technologies. What began as a retreat from state-controlled money, has
become a pursuit of freedom from
[broader](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/01/31/end.html#:~:text=Rather%20than%20just,at%20every%20level.)
dependencies. [Vitalik
Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin), the inventor
of the prominent crypto protocol
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/), has
famously
[stated](https://www.polygon.com/22709126/ethereum-creator-world-of-warcraft-nerf-nft-vitalik-buterin)
his invention of the [shared computing
platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs) was,
in part, a response to having one of his favorite video games changed
without notice or input.

>
> ---   [Vitalik
    Buterin](https://twitter.com/zemnmez/status/1443821271045845005/photo/1)

These principles of self-determination are also tightly tied with
[privacy](https://safecomputing.umich.edu/privacy/history-of-privacy-timeline).
A lack of privacy can result in altered behavior---either through
fearful self-censorship or due to intervention by surveilling
institutions (of which the internet has a [long
tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Lantern_(software))
of).

Distributed systems that grant sovereignty and privacy by default make
surveillance harder for states. What institutions may give up in
[control](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2022/6/29/local-control-or-centralized-planning-theres-a-third-answer#:~:text=And%20the%20latter%2C%20perhaps%20paradoxically%2C%20requires%20relinquishing%20some%20control%20and%20tolerating%20a%20little%20more%20chaos),
though, they gain in resilience by empowering citizens to engage more
deeply in maintaining their own tools and places.

### Empowered Participation Through Direct Ownership

Throughout most of human history, people were inescapably intertwined
with their home place and their neighbors. Today the path of least
resistance is outsourcing all home and placemaking activities to
professionals in exchange for money. Even local governments often use
outside
[consultants](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/industries/government-public-services.html?icid=top_government-public-services)
to accomplish their work. As we've discussed, this prosthesis dampens
our sensitivity to the people and places around us, and erodes the
health of our society.

Community computing networks allow people to build tools to own and
actively participate in the making of their community rather than paying
a 'specialist' outside the community. This principle began with
Bitcoin's approach to money, but now this infrastructure is poised to
provide a more relational and engaging path to community management more
broadly---in support of collaborative processes like collective
budgeting and [mapping of
potholes](https://communityscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AssetMappingToolkit.pdf).

### Composability & Openness

For many potential uses of community computing, the question is often
asked pointedly, '<a href="https://blockchainforgov.org/">why does this need to be on a
blockchain?</a>' One of those
reasons is that distributed protocols lend
[composability](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/).
This means that infrastructure natively brings tools in relationship. In
the world of [Ethereum](https://login.xyz/), users don't
create a user login for individual applications, but instead carry their
universal accounts with them. This not only simplifies user experience
but integrates available payment, identity, and voting solutions for any
application on the network.

These open maps of relationships, when combined with appropriate privacy
considerations, can produce new kinds of
[collaborative](https://cofi.informal.systems/),
synergistic relationships that are impossible to achieve in a world of intellectual
[proprietarianism](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Beyond_Foucault_Excursions_in_Political/o4hyDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA121&printsec=frontcover).

Blockchains not only provide the technical infrastructure for more
collaborative technology, they also carry the [cooperative
ethos](https://theblockchainsocialist.com/safeguarding-ethereums-soul-protocol-guild-and-governing-the-digital-commons/)
of open source digital projects that has been thriving for years, with
[The Cathedral and the
Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/)
as the seminal 'theological' work. Many of its [19
lessons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software)
for creating good open source software are also cultural cornerstones in
the world of
[crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAMzAOhn1KY),
including making 'users' into collaborators, and the free sharing of
code.

### Social Scalability

Many of the failures of today\'s institutions are not necessarily
because they are by some definition *too large* but because the
technology and organizational structures they are built on can no longer
remain sensitive to interpersonal relationship at their current scale.
Nick Szabo pioneered the argument that blockchains allow shared
endeavors (what he calls institutions) to scale beyond what is typically
locally and socially viable through traditional means, calling this
[social
scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=Social%20scalability%20is,can%20successfully%20participate.).

> The number and variety of people who can successfully participate in
> an online institution is far less often restricted by the objective
> limits of computers and networks than it is by limitations of mind and
> institution that have not yet been sufficiently redesigned or further
> evolved to take advantage of those technological improvements.
>
> ---   [Nick
    Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo),
    <i>[Money, blockchains, and social
    scalability](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=the%20number%20and,those%20technological%20improvements.)</i>

Blockchains can remake standards of relating at scale to more
appropriately integrate local sovereignty. Their infrastructure is not
mediated by any authority so the network is open to anyone by default,
without need for social context or permission. Most tools built on
blockchains are [open
source](https://opensource.com/article/20/10/open-source-blockchain),
so their code can be reused (or '<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-forks/#:~:text=FORKS%20IN%20BLOCKCHAIN%3A,so%20that%20anyone%20can%20contribute." target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>forked</a>')
by future communities. These cultural foundations support the
possibility for '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6OgRki5SgM&t=1171s" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>exit</a>',
allowing members to depart and establish new communities when
disagreements or divergences arise. The ability to access, and if
necessary,
[exit](https://molochdao.com/docs/introduction/wtf-is-moloch/#:~:text=Moloch%20was%20popularized%20due%20to%20its%20Minimum%20Viable%20DAO%20design%20and%20the%20advent%20of%20%E2%80%9Cragequit%E2%80%9D%20%2D%20a%20means%20for%20members%20to%20exit%20the%20DAO%20by%20exchanging%20their%20shares%20for%20a%20pro%2Drata%20claim%20on%20the%20treasury%27s%20assets.)
crypto networks and communities results in a dynamic,

and iterative ecosystem, all key factors in fostering agency.

## Cultural Diversity in Crypto

While open systems can create the right conditions for agency, there is
the
[tendency](https://theblockchainsocialist.com/talking-politics-with-vitalik-buterin-part-2/)
in the world of crypto to favor censorship resistance and [minimized
governance](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/10/870) over
social flexibility to achieve
[incorruptibility](https://bank.dev/why#:~:text=Understanding%20that%20every%20theoretical%20incentive%20incompatability%20is%20guaranteed%20to%20be%20exploited.).
The ability to make open, general purpose, permanent and uncensorable
tools is important, but so is the ability to have
[stewardable](https://venkatesh-rao.gitbook.io/summer-of-protocols/#_1znhggknfsxb),
[socially responsive
technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyaWFicSihE).
In her
[research](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-economicsciences2009.pdf),
Elinor Ostrom found that locally maintained systems often work better
than 'superior' engineered solutions because the former are maintained
with active engagement. Permanent systems designed without the need for
maintenance are susceptible to disuse and disengagement. If the goal is
to improve systems of self-organization, then we must welcome social
process.

This tension between the universal
[accessibility](https://otherinter.net/research/three-body-problem/#:~:text=But%20the%20true%20culprit%20behind%20this%20poisonous%20idea%20is%20the%20principle%20of%20credible%20neutrality.)
of formal and rigid systems and the invitation to local spontaneous
engagement potentiated by more [informal
systems](https://informal.systems/about) has been the
subject of debates in the communities of the
[Ethereum](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=i.-,Ethereum,-The%20computer%20that)
and [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) blockchains.

Ethereum is designed to function
[best](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1540427123839713280)
as an
[immutable](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=i.-,Censorship%20resistance,-Ordinarily%2C%20if%20there%E2%80%99s)
and permanent source of 'universal' truth. This helps make tools
composable, interoperable, and free of dependencies---over time building
a robust web of resilient yet accessible infrastructure.

If we aim to use technologies like
[blockchains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)
as an
[alternative](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/12/30/institutions.html#:~:text=Creating%20formal%20structures,of%20challenges%20too.)
or companion to large institutions, we should [be
careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyaWFicSihE&t=617s)
not make them too
[inflexible](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1524480545689903104)
in the name of stability. Social systems are complex and we cannot treat
[our
expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)
for them as rules as hard as the setting of the sun.

Healthy natural systems have mechanisms for unwinding or
[relieving](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/ecological-benefits-fire)
built up pressure, and so must we in our technological systems. Such
architectures may come from communities like
[Cosmos](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1330600018777157633)
(and
[Celestia](https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1548345842431455236)),
which seek to provide
[local](https://otherinter.net/research/three-body-problem/#:~:text=From%20this%20vantage,society%20unto%20itself.)
sovereignty at the community level, with more degrees of freedom in
designing how to build and maintain social consensus---but also with
more responsibility for maintaining [critical
infrastructure](https://v1.cosmos.network/intro#:~:text=A%20sovereign%20blockchain,has%20limited%20sovereignty.).

Together, these new foundations of community computing can help forge
pathways of polycentric, cosmolocal agency propagation toward strong
local resilience and community memory over generations---where specific
communities are empowered to maintain locally sensitive infrastructure
alongside more universally available and [credibly
neutral](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/) rails
for sharing knowledge.
