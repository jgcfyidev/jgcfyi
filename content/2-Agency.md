## Distance and (Lack of) Trust

The story told is that monolithic institutions are necessary because
there are no good alternatives. In such a complex world, how else could
we stabilize
[fragile](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/3/17/the-tragic-downside-of-efficiency#:~:text=Efficient%20is%20the%20same%20as%20fragile.)
modern economies other than through
[rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_planning#Rational_planning_tradition)
analysis and precise engineering by
[well-credentialed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried#Early_life_and_education)
professionals?

It is clear, though, that trust in our
[institutions](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/)
(and [each
other](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/))
is unsustainably low. Our society doesn't feel particularly stable, nor
are our externalities well-accounted for. And so, in recent decades, we
have reason to doubt the proposition that
[predict-and-provide](https://www.culturechange.org/issue8/predict%20and%20provide.htm)
modes of planning can stabilize and provision livable places.

For large-scale organizational structures to produce a sense of [shared
societal
trust](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-015-9322-8),
the breadth of their scope must be balanced by a reverence for local
agency. Our systems of government have become incomprehensible to us
precisely because they extend us no trust and leave no room for
[dialogue](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273580417_A_Study_on_Dialogic_Communication_Trust_and_Distrust_Testing_a_Scale_for_Measuring_Organization-Public_Dialogic_Communication_OPDC).
Thankfully, effective systems of affectionate and
collaborative placemaking are emerging as
[alternatives](https://mises.org/wire/fight-state-build-alternatives-state)
to the escalation of intractable
[externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization_and_Its_Discontents)
and concentration of power.

## Proximity and Congruity

Management-at-a-distance has yielded institutions that fumblingly [mold
local
places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law)
into the limited shapes they're capable of producing, often incongruous
with local biophysical reality. And, while [local
decision-making](https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/1/3/22/htm)
isn't a
[panacea](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1536785653672853510),
it does not unduly pursue omniscience with the same hubris as
'objective' [data-driven
decision-making](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-driven-decision-making)
models do. Planning at scale just isn't the capable scientific
[exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality)
central planners think it to be. Instead, metabolizing information from
places with distinct local realities expends high levels of
organizational energy and yields often unusably aggregated observations.
This problem was the thrust of [FA
Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek)'s
seminal work, *[The Use of Knowledge in
Society](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html).*

> The sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge
> of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and
> therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical
> form. The statistics which such a central authority would have to use
> would have to be arrived at precisely by abstracting from minor
> differences between the things, by lumping together... in a way which
> may be very significant for the specific decision.
>
> --- FA Hayek, *The Use of Knowledge in Society*

### Overestimating Rationality

A social theory called the [Garbage Can
Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_can_model)
describes the messy reality of organizational decision-making at scale. This model suggests that, despite their intentions, groups of
people don't typically make decisions by agreeing on a problem,
developing a [perfect
understanding](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous)
of all the data, then picking the best-fitting solution. Instead,
decision-makers most often decide on one of a few solutions that happen
to be available at the time and then [work
backward](https://youtu.be/2V4QYC-PRIw?t=268) toward a
logical-sounding justification for that solution.

> Problems and solutions and individuals and so on are mixed in the
> garbage can of a choice by their temporal simultaneity, not by their

> G.March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5geJSDqGIr4&t=115s)

### Overestimating Capability

The [planning
fallacy](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/planning-fallacy)
is a related mental model that describes the tendency of individuals and
institutions to underestimate the time, costs, and risks associated with
completing a task, often despite past experiences. While those
involved may blame this poor judgment on a [basic human
tendency](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2007/october/study_reveals_how_the_brain.html)
for optimism, the phenomenon is also likely related to professionals who
believe themselves more capable than the population they are planning
for---no matter the local intricacies (and, *of course*, unrelated to the
influence and money that might [flow through
them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMGr4yyE1uc&t=1843s)).
No matter the cause, overconfidence at such a scale can lead to more
impactful externalities than are possible with more distributed models
of placemaking.

One of the most infamous examples of large institutions\' tendency to
underestimate costs is the [Big
Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig#:~:text=The%20project%20was%20originally%20scheduled%20to%20be%20completed%20in%201998%5B3%5D%20at%20an%20estimated%20cost%20of%20%242.8%20billion%20(in%201982%20dollars%2C%20US%247.4%20billion%20adjusted%20for%20inflation%20as%20of%202020).%5B4%5D%20However%2C%20the%20project%20was%20completed%20in%20December%202007%20at%20a%20cost%20of%20over%20%248.08%20billion),
a large highway project in Boston designed to reroute I-93 out of the
core of downtown. Ironically, the decision for the highway to be there
[in the first
place](https://highways.dot.gov/highway-history/interstate-system/original-intent-purpose-interstate-system-1954-1956#:~:text=Perhaps%20the%20greatest%20failure%2C%20however%2C%20was%20that%20the%20Interstate%20System%20did%20not%20relieve%20congestion.)
was a result of prioritizing central planning over-sensitivity to local
neighborhoods.

Originally set for completion in 1998 at an estimated cost of \$7.4
billion, the project instead stretched on nearly a decade longer and
cost over 21.5 billion (adjusted for inflation), making it the most
expensive highway project in the history of the United States. In
addition to delays and overrun costs, the project was mired with
criminal charges and even a death.

While
[big](https://mysteriouschicago.com/finding-daniel-burnhams-no-little-plans-quote/#:~:text=Make%20no%20little%20plans%2C%20they%20have%20no%20magic%20in%20them%20to%20stir%20men%E2%80%99s%20blood)
plans often have big societal effects, they aren't always what [we
intend](https://highways.dot.gov/highway-history/interstate-system/original-intent-purpose-interstate-system-1954-1956#:~:text=The%20next%2040,and%20its%20cities.).
Even when our grand plans produce more efficient infrastructure,
[Jevons
Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)
shows us that efficiency can yield unforeseen increases in demand and in
turn, overall resource use. This [induced
demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand) is
well-studied in city planning, where widening roads often simply invites
more traffic rather than solving traffic problems.

## Legibility and Responsiveness

Formalized organizational structures don't just overestimate their
competency, they also
[reshape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law)
[places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique)
(and
[people](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/12/us/la-sheriff-employees-suicide/index.html))
in their image for the purpose of predictability and
[legibility](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/).
This concept is explored in [James C.
Scott\'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott)
fantastic book, *[Seeing Like a
State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State)*,
looking at German forestry management practices in the early 19th
century.

> The utopian, immanent, and continually frustrated goal of the modern
> state is to reduce the chaotic, disorderly, constantly changing social
> reality beneath it to something more closely resembling the
> administrative grid of its observations.
>
> ― James C. Scott, *[Seeing Like a
> State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State)*

As the early German state
[sought](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09505431.2010.519866)
to maximize timber yields for tax revenue, it began promoting
'scientific forestry',
[initiating](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/#:~:text=The%20early%20modern,monoculture%20%E2%80%94%20were%20inevitable)
"the gradual transformation of forests with a rich diversity of species
growing wildly and randomly into orderly stands of the highest-yielding
varieties."

Despite the intention to increase efficiency and profitability, the lack
of consideration for the complexity and diversity of natural ecosystems
ultimately led to harmful ecological imbalance and decline. By the late
19th and early 20th century, these monocultures revealed their clear
[vulnerability](https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/horizon-magazine/rise-and-fall-monoculture-farming)
to disease, leading to a crisis in German forestry that has
[never](https://www.science.org/content/article/germany-s-trees-are-dying-fierce-debate-has-broken-out-over-how-respond)
truly resolved.

{{<image src="/media/image1.png" caption="Illegible natural vs. legible 'scientific' forests - James C. Scott, <a href='https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Seeing Like a State</a>">}}

When our communities themselves are made to be more measurable,
traditional
[modes](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1607836919517544448)
of local responsiveness break down. Without engaged residents capable of
sustaining the physical health of a place, economic measures of
'success' become instead a self-referential measure of state influence.
Like a
[rejected](https://uvahealth.com/services/transplant/transplant-rejection)
organ transplant, these artificial structures are eventually
[resisted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)
and reclaimed, but not without
[disfiguring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive#The_original_cobra_effect)
our places for decades or more---as has been the case with German
forestry.

Today, it is not just the state's demand for legibility that is
[harming rich
ecologies](https://agaveroadtrip.com/episodes/s4e28-problem-with-the-washington-post-article-about-mezcal#:~:text=But%20instead%20we%E2%80%99re%20all%20drinking%20spirits%20made%20from%20monoculture%20blue%20weber%20agave%20in%20Jalisco%20and%20soon%2Dto%2Dbe%2Dmonoculture%20espadin%20in%20Oaxaca).
Technological systems for scaling agriculture---like [robotic apple

making our food systems in their image. Despite the techno-optimist's

that affectionate

in relationship with natural ecologies produce more healthy, resilient
and productive, if less legible, food systems than their institutional
or technological counterparts.

with responsiveness and care. Only people with sufficient proximity and
[affection](https://spiritoftheland.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/It-All-Turns-On-Affection-Wendell-Berry.pdf)
enough for the places and people around them can understand the problems
they are facing and [generate appropriate
solutions](https://twitter.com/PeterGelderloos/status/1560669192461815808),
even if these aren't as well-engineered or as justified by data as

we work toward capacity for local self-organization. These ideas have

## Relationship and Dialogue 

In her Nobel Prize-winning research, Elinor Ostrom
[analyzed](https://youtu.be/T6OgRki5SgM?t=1779) irrigation
systems and fisheries all over the world. She found that 72% of
farmer-managed systems had high performance (in terms of yield and cost)
compared to 42% of agency-run systems, despite having experts and
flawless engineering on their side. How is this possible?

The tragedy of the commons is an
[apparent](https://aeon.co/essays/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-is-a-false-and-dangerous-myth)
dilemma often
[referenced](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tragedy-of-the-commons.asp#:~:text=Regulatory%20Solutions)
[as
justification](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1619877114#:~:text=Hardin%E2%80%99s%20solution%20was%20to%20cede%20our%20freedoms%20to%20the%20state%2C%20to%20be%20bound%20by%20%E2%80%9Cmutual%20coercion%20mutually%20agreed%20upon%E2%80%9D)
for formalized institutional intervention into resource management. It
[states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#:~:text=a%20situation%20in,resources.%5B3%5D)
that without externally imposed rules,
'[rational](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2585925)'
individual users will overuse resources, depleting long-term and
community-wide viability contrary to the common good of all users. This
definition of rationality assumes an economy decoupled from
relationship.

Ostrom\'s pioneering research focused on the vital role of coordination
in the management of
[common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)-[pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource)
resources, including forests, irrigation systems, and groundwater. She
[concluded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6OgRki5SgM&t=2200s)
that groups lacking avenues for communication did indeed abuse their
shared resources. She also observed, however, that simply introducing
the possibility of
[face-to-face](https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2009/12/02/cooperation-versus-self-interest-the-theory-of-collective-action-and-its-relevance-to-project-management/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20research%20shows,transfer%20information.)

allowed for the kind of greatly increased
[cooperation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kHZ0a_6TxY)
that
[outperformed](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-govern-ment-owned-Chiregad-irrigation-system-right-panel-was-construct-ed-in_fig1_13102089)
professionally engineered systems,
[saying](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2585925), "policies
based on the assumptions that individuals can learn how to devise
well-tailored rules and cooperate conditionally when they participate in
the design of institutions affecting them are more successful."

And so the tragedy of the commons is not some sort of hard
[scientific](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40368894)
inevitability that necessitates institutional oversight from central
planners in order to
[save](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_planning)
helplessly 'rational' individuals from themselves, but a symptom of an
insufficiently relational environment. To move forward, we must reframe
what organizational competence looks like. Rather than adherence to
institutional [best
practices](https://highways.dot.gov/federal-lands/design/library),
the social and technical
[capacity](https://sesmad.dartmouth.edu/theories/95) for
collaborative self-organization is perhaps the most important
prerequisite for healthy communities.

### Data Analysis Can't Replace Community Memory

Capacity for this kind of relational self-organization is built through
customs, tools, and technologies
[embedded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXGbCjzmm2M) in
their specific
[social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embeddedness#:~:text=Exchange%20takes%20place%20within%20and%20is%20regulated%20by%20society%20rather%20than%20being%20located%20in%20a%20social%20vacuum.)
and [ecological](https://sesmad.dartmouth.edu/theories/95)
contexts. It emerges through
[dialogue](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/are-we-still-thinking)
and tradition more often than formal design principles. These
generational relationships anchor problem-solving in place and create
the kind of local
[memory](https://thoughtforms.life/but-where-is-the-memory-a-discussion-of-training-gene-regulatory-networks-and-its-implications/#:~:text=So%20where%20is%20the%20memory%20in%20such%20a%20system%3F%20It%E2%80%99s%20in%20the%20relationship%20between%20it%20and%20the%20observer.)
required to learn and carry the present into the future.

So, the biggest reason institutions fail to foster resilient communities
is not that they lack the computational firepower, but a persistent
generational memory. Despite the strength of their quantitative models,
the consultants that write the plans for our places are only paid to
care long enough to meet the terms of their contract. Over time,
incentives fall toward suggesting [yet another
study](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20important%20to,the%20original%20version.)
instead of following up on previous ideas with no remaining
champion---creating loops of wasted effort. Unfortunately these loops
often go unnoticed by a disengaged population that has not been invited
into the process.

## Spontienty and Informality

It is worth stating explicitly that, while they offer the

foster our capacity for collaboration and build a coherent [community

to counter these tendencies. But, since a healthy society [depends on
more](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1543957797976547329) than simply scorning non-local institutions, we must first better
understand what healthy patterns of locally sensitive relationship looks
like.

### Relational Places

Even small extensions of trust can go a long way to building healthy
relationships between people and a place. The urbanist William H. Whyte
famously observed in *[The Social Life Of Small Urban
Spaces](https://www.pps.org/product/the-social-life-of-small-urban-spaces)*
that people feel more comfortable in public spaces that allow them to
[move their
chairs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bryantpark/6967693506/in/set-72157629899969863/#:~:text=1983%3A%20Urbanist%20William%20H.%20Whyte%20advocated%20movable%20seating%20in%20public%20spaces%2C%20citing%20the%20social%20limitations%20of%20fixed%20seating%2C%20such%20as%20benches%20and%20railings.%20Bryant%20Park%20is%20now%20undeniably%20social%2C%20with%204%2C120%20chairs.).
This kind of physical informality builds trust and invites engagement.

> is why, perhaps, people so often move a chair a few inches this way
> and that before sitting in it, with the chair ending up about where it

Whyte](https://www.urbancincy.com/2010/05/clifton-plaza-an-early-success-improvements-needed/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20possibility%20of,and%20rather%20satisfying.%E2%80%9D), *The Social Life Of Small Urban

## Extension of Trust Means Giving Up Power

In community governance, extending trust to individuals and small
communities empowers them to change their neighborhoods themselves,
reducing reliance on unsustainably distant decision-making processes and
providing a richer and more engaging life for their citizens. This
empowering trust, however, is in short supply for structures of
governance reluctant to give up their influence.

### Feigned Extensions of Trust

The reality of complex regulatory and approval
[processes](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/11/7/when-we-make-it-hard-to-build-we-give-developers-more-power-over-our-communities)
in our home places means community-building is only accessible to the
well-capitalized or well-connected. Even as
[governments](http://fourthplan.org/action/public-participation)
discover that open communication and engagement are important, their
half-hearted community meetings are still too often just dressed-up
placation that neuter the creative spirit of their constituents. Real
engagement can only happen when those with influence start asking what
processes can be trusted with community members completely.

### Freedom as a Product

While our governments maintain their resource-heavy
[micromanagement](https://twitter.com/izurietavarea/status/1668276028110782465),
some of the world's most successful corporations have succeeded by
learning to relinquish control and become
[platforms](https://hbr.org/2016/04/products-to-platforms-making-the-leap#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20a%20large%20number%20of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20most%20valuable%20companies%20by%20market%20capitalization%20in%202015%20were%20platform%20companies%2C%20including%20five%20of%20the%20top%2010%20(Apple%2C%20Microsoft%2C%20Google%2C%20Amazon%2C%20and%20Facebook).)
instead of product providers.

In Steve Yegge\'s famous 2011
[rant](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611) on
\'Google vs. Amazon\', he shows how centralized decision-making and
product release can't be as dynamic and robust as a platform
architecture that enables other teams and individuals to release their
own products with minimal oversight. Instead of selling books
themselves, Amazon let everyone sell their own books. Eventually, they
would expand this posture to their prolific [web
services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services)
as well.

> The first big thing Bezos realized is that the infrastructure they\'d
> built for selling and shipping books and sundry could be transformed
> [into] an excellent repurposable computing platform. The other big
> realization he had was that he can\'t ... build one product and have
> it be right for everyone.
>

> Yegge](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611)

### Platforms and Products

Platform architectures are now ubiquitous, where in places like Apple\'s
App Store, independent producers offer a wider range of more specialized
software than a single company could ever make itself. YouTube and
social media platforms similarly host a whole universe of user-generated
content.

The difference between these
[platforms](https://outland.art/art-games/#:~:text=This%20is%20also%20how%20platform%20capitalism%20works),
though, and the agency-delivering organizational structures we should
aspire to is that the platform owners can [take away
access](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-lost-cities-of-geo/transcript/#:~:text=And%20then%2C%20the%20world%20ended.)
or [censor
communication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-020-00423-6)
[whenever they
want](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/reddit-users-go-dark-in-protest-of-policy-that-could-shut-out-third-party-apps).
Without giving full control to users, platforms can
[only](https://twitter.com/0x113d/status/1754293993133728160)
offer a taste of what more empowering organizational technologies can
offer in terms of trustworthiness, interoperability, and permanence.

These [technological](https://summerofprotocols.com/research) building blocks offer the scaffolding for replicable alternatives to central planning and will see much more discussion in the final essays of this series.

## Alternatives to Central Planning

How can we build organizational alternatives to dispiriting
institutional governance and the [false
agency](https://outland.art/art-games/#:~:text=crisis%20of%20agency,infinitesimally%20small%20pathways.)
of corporate platforms? While some have opted out by [eschewing
society](https://twitter.com/cognazor/status/1699778244952670709?s=20)
altogether, we are capable of forming more healthy modes of
organization---ones that both honor the
[complexity](https://youtu.be/T6OgRki5SgM?t=1081) of
specific places and are benefited by their relationship to a broader
society.

[Polycentric](https://sites.warnercnr.colostate.edu/rebeccagruby/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2014/01/CarlisleGruby_Polycentricity_InPress.pdf)
organizational structures, with [multiple centers of semi-autonomous
decision-making](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/psj.12212#:~:text=multiple%20centers%20of%20semiautonomous%20decision%20making),
are one path forward. In what biologist [Michael
Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levin_(biologist))
calls a '[multi-scale competency
architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a3xg4M9Oa8)',
such aggregated patterns of autonomous local problem-solving are exactly
how our bodies self-organize to perform as a whole.

> All intelligence is collective intelligence
>
> ---[Michael Levin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1185s)

Advocated for by [Elinor
Ostrom](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27871226), these
structures grant power to traditional, formalized entities as well as
private, voluntary, and community-based non-governmental actors. In this
way, higher forms of organization (like state and federal governance)
can focus on providing physical and organizational infrastructure that
[leaves
processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity) and
outcomes in the hands of locally originating organizations.

Gandhi spoke of [oceanic
circles](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1540426640878190594):
concentric circles of societal organization where power and action
derive from the individual and radiate to the village, region, state,
and finally to the nation. This thinking acknowledges the existence of
broader contexts of organization without giving them undue power over
contexts they cannot properly manage.

> In this structure composed of innumerable villages there will be
> ever-widening, never-ascending circles. Life will not be a pyramid
> with the apex sustained by the bottom. But it will be an oceanic
> circle whose centre will be the individual ... Therefore, the
> outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner
> circle, but will give strength to all within and derive its own
> strength from it.
>
> --- Gandhi, *[Panchayat
Raj](https://www.gandhiashramsevagram.org/mind-of-mahatma-gandhi/panchayat-raj.php#:~:text=In%20this%20structure,strength%20from%20it.)*

{{<image src="/media/image26.png" caption="<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekT_WpgBQ0w&t=2516s' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Visualization</a> of Gandhi's Oceanic Circles">}}

Today, community-building practitioners like
[Microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/five-scales-of-microsolidarity)
are also thinking about concentric governance structures, nested in
[relationship](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels/status/1718260144813875668)
but non-hierarchical. Their model is structured around a progression
from the self-as-a-group → the dyad (2 people) → the crew (about 3-5) →
the congregation (about 15-150) → the network of congregations.

{{<image src="/media/image12.png" caption="A <a href='https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/a-developmental-pathway' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>developmental pathway</a> to building a networked organization via Microsolidarity">}}

Another emerging paradigm,
[cosmolocalism](https://actionforesight.net/cosmo-localism-and-the-futures-of-material-production/)
seeks to strengthen and fortify local manufacturing and resource
management by leveraging a globally accessible [digital
commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)).
This movement is embodied in makerspaces---community-centered workshops
equipped with tools like
[CNC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTi7dnwYTVw)
machines and 3D printers, and full of creators making their often open
source designs available globally online. [This
kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAtK-lpazc4) of
internet-based
[collaboration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOYa3YzVtyk)
can help local places remain resilient and independent, while sharing
valuable information on manufacturing, farming and other necessary
skills to their mutual benefit.

> A relocalization which does not draw from a global knowledge and
> design commons and which is relegated to only local knowledge can at
> best produce 'lifeboat' relocalization and at worst will not produce
> basic sufficiency.
>
> --- [José Ramos, Action
> Foresight](https://actionforesight.net/cosmo-localism-and-the-futures-of-material-production/#:~:text=A%20relocalization%20which%20does%20not%20draw%20from%20a%20global%20knowledge%20and%20design%20commons%20and%20which%20is%20relegated%20to%20only%20local%20knowledge%20can%20at%20best%20produce%20%E2%80%98life%20boat%E2%80%99%20relocalization%20and%20at%20worst%20will%20not%20produce%20basic%20sufficiency.)

When paired with polycentric organizational structures, these kinds of
networks can help to proliferate relevant local knowledge across
regions. This work is intimate, granting agency at the most local
levels, but also affords us the ability to weave these local
organizational systems into a collective, supportive whole through
[mycorrhizal
networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWD_1Nq6iwQ) of
collective and continuous community
[memory](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/216/20/3799/11714/An-automated-training-paradigm-reveals-long-term).

## Physical Infrastructure for Trust

New organizational alternatives to central planning require some
capacity for local mutual trust exactly at the time when it has [gone
missing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-015-9322-8).
In his 1925 book *The Collective Memory*, Maurice Halbwachs established
the deep influence that physical places have on the ability of
communities to maintain and transmit their collective identities and
histories.

> Most groups engrave their form in some way upon the soil and retrieve
> their collective remembrances within the spatial framework.
>
> --- [Maurice Halbwachs](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/hawlbachsspace.pdf), *The Collective Memory*

Eric Klinenberg's 2018 [Palaces for the
People](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/palaces-for-the-people/)
continues in this lineage, exploring how [social
infrastructure](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gec3.12444)---physical
infrastructure that embeds social relationship into daily
life---[helps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhU45EgFb6Y)
make people happier, more trusting of their neighbors, and even safer in
crisis.

During the [1995 Chicago heat
wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Chicago_heat_wave)
that killed 739 people, certain neighborhoods produced fewer deaths,
even when accounting for other social factors like race and income.
Klinenberg found the reason was that these neighborhoods had better
social infrastructure---like shaded sidewalks, active street-level
vendors, and libraries that facilitated social relationships. Neighbors
in these places were much more likely to check in on each other during
the heatwave or notice that a certain neighbor was missing from their
daily routine.

As an alternative to the kind of agency-eroding [surveillance in the
name of
safety](https://cityterritoryarchitecture.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40410-018-0090-8)
currently being [marketed to
cities](https://spectrumsmartcities.com/articles/temperature-monitoring.html),
communities have the opportunity to raise up [physical
infrastructure](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/hawlbachsspace.pdf)
to foster safety nets of neighborly affection that both make us happier
and save lives.

## Can Technology Help?

While well-cared-for places serve as the cornerstone of a sustainable
society, we cannot love them well without suitable tools of
coordination. Despite its recent contributions to our collective
forgetting of generational stewardship, technology should not be viewed
as the enemy of local resilience. The distinction must be made between
technologies that empower local agency and those which create dependency
on outside resources.

> Culture and individual memory are constantly produced through, and
> mediated by, the technologies of memory.

> ---   [Marita
    Sturken](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602368#:~:text=Culture%20and%20individual%20memory%20are%20constantly%20produced%20through%2C%20and%20mediated%20by%2C%20the%20technologies%20of%20memory.), *The memory remains*

Wonderfully, the world of open-source software development has [shown
us](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0256090920140212#:~:text=The%20findings%20of,produce%20information%20goods.)
that it is possible to challenge institutionalized norms and build
parallel systems of organization with real legitimacy, especially with
the internet as a substrate for coordination. In subsequent parts of
this series, we'll discuss explicitly how new protocols for coordination
can help move our physical communities toward a society with more
agency.
