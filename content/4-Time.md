Agency and limits both are strongly supported by traditions of
generational knowledge transfer, rooted in specific place. Equilibrial
investment and draw from local resources over generations grounds a
community in time and place, giving joy in the present and assurance of
the future.

> Invest in the millenium. Plant sequoias.\
> Say that your main crop is the forest\

> that you will not live to harvest.\

So far, we have discussed how affectionate relationship unlocks pathways
for agency and limits to emerge in balance toward resilient home places.
Now, we will explore how this equilibrium is matured across generations
as we build local community memory---traditions of knowledge transfer
edified by our relationship to that which came before us, and which
comes after. Without these traditions, our rootlessness leads our
children to increasingly fragile dependence.

## Place in Time and Time in Place

A culture can be understood as an accumulation of its people's various
traditions---of language, land-stewardship, cooking, gathering, and many
other practices. Stewart Brand's
[conception](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand/release/2)
of pace layering below describes society's nested, polycentric
orientation to time, with slow-changing natural systems and their
resulting cultures at the core. Here we can see that affection for our
place not only grounds our relationship to each other and limits, but
also to time.

{{<image src="/media/image7.png" caption="Pace Layering Visualized">}}

As our cultural center
[moves](https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/a-world-of-difference-the-transformation-from-physical-to/430683)
away from the slowness of [natural
systems](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_modern_life_became_disconnected_from_nature),
we are no longer [in
conversation](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/19/11870#:~:text=Unlike%20historical%20memory%E2%80%94a%20collection,memory%20alive%E2%80%9D%20%5B32%5D.)
with the past or [our
place](https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/a-world-of-difference-the-transformation-from-physical-to/430683).
Accelerated by the virality of internet phenomena, [the
present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture#:~:text=in%20a%20society-,at%20a%20given%20point%20in%20time.,-Popular%20culture%20also)
comes to [pass
quickly](https://x.com/Historiographos/status/1729493204666577359?s=20),
leaving us with [shortened memory
spans](https://x.com/SethLargo/status/1727163521962528987?s=20)
and without cultural footholds. Instead of a song to sing to our
children, our story is now a
[firehose](https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-day-in-america-lyrics#:~:text=Circling%20the%20drain%20to,processed%0APulsed%2C%20like%20vegetables)

This unmoored culture, in pursuit of universal understanding,
destabilizes our sense of

### Transience vs. Presence in the Natural World

How do we escape the unpleasant
[trend-chasing](https://i-d.vice.com/en/article/y3vj8m/trendcore-tiktok)
of pop culture without fetishizing a [conception of the
past](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/news-events/all-news/faculty-news/why-we-romanticize-the-past.html)
[sourced](https://lifeinwestamerica.com/) from a
place-agnostic internet or hoping for a future that is enduring only in
its failure to arrive? How can we ground ourselves appropriately in
time? Only through our home places.

Historically, long-standing connections between people and their places
have rooted their traditions and their collective memory in a slow-paced
ecological rhythm, but this was not necessarily out of some prescient
wisdom. Before the technological capability to regularly consume
resources from anywhere on earth, communities necessarily had to more
fully provide for themselves within the context of their local
environment.

While our consumption is no longer technically restrained to our places
in the same way, local affection and relationship to a specific place is
still the best way to
[orient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-DUcbk58OI&t=41s)
ourselves in time. Without this
[anchor](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Totem), we lose
our ability to perceive ecological limits and build stable identities to
carry us forward over the coming generations. Resilience is no longer
something we inherit from our places, but something we must choose by
binding ourselves to them.

> The Amish are far less captive to the future than the rest of us, and
> that is because their lives are so complexly serviceable to their land
> and their neighbors in the present. And so they are providing for the
> future as fully and effectively as humans possibly can.
>
> --- Wendell Berry, The Art of Loading Brush

### Redefining Progress

Because of the sanctity of our home places, we cannot see the future as
some infinite piggy bank from which to draw. Solving problems by
assuming resources will be readily supplied by outside communities at
some unspecified point in the
[future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism)
is not innovation or progress but laziness and greed--- a "movement from
old damage to new destruction," as Berry puts it.

> As a people we have escaped to the West from the East, from the
> country to the city, from the city to the suburbs, from the suburbs
> back to the country or back to the city. And because we have never
> known well enough, or worked well enough, where we were, this has
> almost always been a movement from old damage to new destruction, and
> always with the aim of \'a better future for our children.'
>
> ---   Wendell Berry, The Art of Loading Brush

Generational thinking avoids the kind of overuse and excess that
sacrifices [the future for the
present](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1504923071286759428),
but this does not mean we should sacrifice our [present time or place
for the
future](https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/15451/Mulgan_2017_CJP_UtilitarianFuture_AAM.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
either---as some
[utilitarians](https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/15451/Mulgan_2017_CJP_UtilitarianFuture_AAM.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
and [effective
altruists](https://80000hours.org/2020/08/misconceptions-effective-altruism/#:~:text=no%20matter%20where%20or%20when%20they%20live)
may suggest. Instead, we can sustain our communities joyfully both
through the present day and coming generations by leaning on place-based
traditions as a foundation for agency, trust, and humility.

Instead of unsustainable growth by the accrual of existential debt,
progress should be defined by a community's capacity to maintain the
kind of equilibrium that allows it to '[rest upon the
earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_economy#Herman_Daly's_concept_of_a_steady-state_economy)'.
This locally emanating stability conveys more agency to adapt to a
changing world than dependence on broad and abstract organizational
structures.

### Flows of Energy

Healthy natural systems

We see this in

coral reefs, and even our soils. As natural systems mature, these cyclic
patterns spread their available energy over broader [time

that is not a 'movement' but a self-sustaining system with stabilized

deeply in relationship with today's habits.

of natural systems with a bureaucratic wisdom anesthetizes communities
that have adapted to their specific place. Acknowledging natural
ecologies and cultural tradition as foundational to and in relationship
with potential institutions of governance is necessary for the long term
health of a place.

### Traditions in Mezcal

This conflict between quickening forces of change and the stability of
culture rooted in place is seen in the world of Mexican distilling
traditions. Ostensibly created to protect traditional production, the
institutionally regulated Mezcal [denomination of
origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denominaci%C3%B3n_de_origen)
(D.O.) ironically excludes the spirits most representative of
traditional local processes.

Agave distillates (including mezcal) have historically been produced by
families in small batches for [their
village](http://maestrosdelmezcal.com/blog#:~:text=Chances%20are%20you,the%20flavor%20itself))
and personal network. Small mezcaleros typically do not have the money,
legal literacy, or social capital to have their work certified as
'official' mezcal by [federal
institutions](https://www.mezcalistas.com/whats-going-on-with/),
especially when each of their small batches must be approved
individually.

Instead, the mezcals that have the easiest time being certified are
those who's industrialized processes and scale of production make them
more legible to institutional standards. Much has been said of the
[gentrification of
mezcal](https://www.mezcalistas.com/walking-the-line-between-design-and-appropriation/)
by foreign markets, but a shift away from traditional processes is
caused as much by institutional demands on economic (and
[physical](https://agaveroadtrip.com/episodes/s4e28-problem-with-the-washington-post-article-about-mezcal#:~:text=soon%2Dto%2Dbe%2Dmonoculture%20espadin%20in%20Oaxaca))
forms than natural demands of the market.

{{<image-dual height="350px" src1="/media/image5.jpg" src2="/media/image13.png" caption="Mezcal distillation in San Agustin Amatengo vs placeless <a href='https://insidethecask.com/2022/01/18/understanding-mezcal/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>industrial</a> distillation">}}

Despite instiutional intervention, we are capable of learning about the
traditions we are [in
relationship](https://rezpiral.com/30percent/) with and
[supporting](https://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2019/3/4/mezonte)
them. In fact, this is
[regularly](https://www.mezcalreviews.com/mezcal/mezonte-raicilla-japo/#:~:text=When%20Mezonte%20buys%20a%20batch%20from%20a%20producer%2C%20they%20only%20buy%2060%25%20of%20the%20batch%20because%20they%20want%20the%20community%20and%20the%20culture%20of%20the%20community%20to%20continue%20to%20consume%20and%20enjoy%20as%20they%20have%20for%20hundreds%20of%20years.)
true in the world of
'[uncertified](https://www.eater.com/22929882/mezcal-destilado-de-agave-distilling-indigenous-culture-oaxaca)'
agave spirits, where [individual
mezcaleros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F876l0VFc4)
and
[communities](https://netaspirits.com/about-us#:~:text=NETA%20works%20closely%20with%20over%20twenty%20small%2C%20family%20producers%20from%20the%20southern%20valleys%20and%20hills%20of%20Miahuatl%C3%A1n%2C%20Oaxaca%2C%20many%20of%20whom%20are%20members%20of%20the%20cooperative%20Grupo%20Productor%20Logoche.)
are elevated over brand names, and customers are encouraged to visit
producing communities themselves. In this case and many others, systems
that elude or ignore institutional oversight [may be
doing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Not_Being_Governed#:~:text=using%20their%20culture%2C%20farming%20practices%2C%20egalitarian%20political%20structures%2C%20prophet%2Dled%20rebellions%2C%20and%20even%20their%20lack%20of%20writing%20systems%20to%20put%20distance%20between%20themselves%20and%20the%20states%20that%20wished%20to%20engulf%20them.)
so for very good reasons.

## Appropriate Technology

[Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) has
[defined](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=a%20relationship%20or%20shared%20endeavor%2C%20in%20which%20multiple%20people%20repeatedly%20participate%2C%20and%20featuring%20customs%2C%20rules%2C%20or%20other%20features%20which%20constrain%20or%20motivate%20participants%E2%80%99%20behaviors)
an institution as simply "a relationship or shared endeavor, in which
multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or
other features which constrain or motivate participants' behaviors."
Governance, families, and even language are institutions that, aided
with [broadly
defined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYDuOKI8maQ&t=335s)
'technologies' like legal frameworks and voting protocols, can scale and
perpetuate these traditions to allow us to better coordinate our home
places.

### Illegibility and Relationship

These modes of organizing society are not just abstract universal
systems; they are in deep relationship with the physical and cultural
landscapes they inhabit. At the same time---and while acknowledging our
current overdependence on centralized institutions and
technologies---not every process needs to be recreated at the local
level in order to begin to impart greater agency to communities. While
common language among a community is important, for example, there is no
objective measure of what kind of scale is ideal.

[Some communities in southwestern
China](https://folklife.si.edu/magazine/own-words-himalayan-languages-sichuan#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20all%20Qiang%2C%20but%20our%20dialects%2C%20traditions%2C%20folklore%2C%20and%20beliefs%20vary%20widely%20by%20valley%20or%20even%20by%20village%2C%E2%80%9D%20Jianqiong%20explains.%20%E2%80%9CAs%20far%20as%20Black%20Tiger%20goes%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20pretty%20different.%20I%20can%20understand%20about%20thirty%20percent%20of%20the%20words%2C%20but%20it%20is%20hard%20to%20follow.%E2%80%9D)
maintain a common language only local to their village, with neighboring
communities having trouble understanding each other. Many of these
languages have formed in direct relation to the steep valleys these
communities have inhabited for centuries, with [directional
prefixes](https://escholarship.org/content/qt1cv9h87s/qt1cv9h87s_noSplash_93b48610fac39b9dc61517f6a7949d4b.pdf?t=qfpluy)
representative of valley geography (up-river and down-river instead of
north/south). For them, this level of scale is appropriate and the level
of linguistic/ecological intimacy is worth preserving.

In contrast, the nearly global scale of the English language creates
advantages for global business but also may not be able to retain local
memory as well as a smaller language. While there are indeed benefits to
remaining
[illegible](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/james-c-scott-the-art-of-not-being-governed#:~:text=One%20way%20of,Burman%2C%20the%20Thai.)
to broader regulatory structures, a language for every village is
probably not the sweet spot for the coordination of resilient physical
communities at this point in humanity\'s development.

{{<image src="/media/image11.jpg" caption="A photo I took in one such valley-bound <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/wFDAX1ooHZhgDSBk6' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>village</a> in Sichuan in 2013. The camera shutter was giving me issues, rending half of the image illegible, an apt representation of this place.">}}

Instead of having to choose between isolated local traditions or
monolithic unilaterally coordinated institutions, we can employ
technological
[architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZOOWZTaFNA&t=545s)
and tools that respect and support local sovereignty, but network local
places into coherent regional and national polycentric relationship.

### Local Technologies

So how can we determine which tools are productive in moving toward such
a sustainable,
[long-thinking](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/long-distance-thinking?s=r)
society? There is nothing inherently wrong with organizational
structures that span geographies, especially when they serve as
scaffolding for relationships between local places---but when local
traditions are themselves shaped in service of these structures, we put
the cart before the horse. What is the use of relating at scale if the
tools for coordinating these complex relationships require reduced local
fidelity? If national policy goals or technologies gain control over
local social traditions, the system breaks down.

Organizational flows of influence, then, should be in the direction of
[Gandhi\'s oceanic
circles,](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-8476-0_2#:~:text=Gandhi%20argues%20for%20self%2Drule,in%20'ever%2Dwidening%20circles.)
moving outward as a ripple emanating from small communities. In this
architecture, natural ecologies inform local social traditions of care,
which inform local formal methods for organization, which in turn inform
broader formal conventions of relationship.

### New Technologies and Locally Sensitive Alternatives to Institutions

Though today our technologies mostly erode our individual and community
sovereignty, tools for coordination surely have a place in any healthy
society. Chapter 5 and 6 of this series will dig further into emerging
technological pathways for the pursuit of endogenous
sovereignty---including collaborative tools for '[community
computing](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1466092508316905478)'
like
[blockchains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)
and other
[peer-to-peer](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Main_Page)
protocols.

If used appropriately, tools for community computing can impart both
social flexibility and local sensitivity to support us in building
healthy, long-thinking communities with more robust generational memory
than we are capable of with our current institutional and technological
dependencies.
