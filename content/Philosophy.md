# Philosphy of Writing (and Disclaimers)

-   I concede that none of my writing can perfectly represent my thinking, or [truth](https://genius.com/Twain-in-the-high-of-the-morning-lyrics#:~:text=I%20recall%20that%20I%20used%20to%20despair%20at%20the%20lost%20chance%20of%20knowing%0AA%20much%20longed%20for%20beauty%0ABut%20now%20that%20I%20know%20it%27s%20my%20duty%20to%20love%20life%0ANot%20try%20and%20know%20life%0ATo%20show%20it%2Dto%20show%20I%20don%27t%20know%20yet%20I%20know%20that%20it%27s%20real) itself---nor do I possess some unique claim on truth, nor do I possess any particular ability to teach you anything.
-   I don’t think that what I’m writing about is the most important thing, or the only way to do things, it’s just what I happened to think about often enough to write about.
-   I concede that there are many resources and smart people I haven’t had the time or chance to be exposed to yet, including ones that may cause me to update or change my opinions. I welcome those resources and ask that we all acknowledge each other’s limits in knowledge & experience.
-   Because of this, I view these ideas less as static and objective truth, and more a participation in a conversation with many other wonderful people.
-   When I speak generally, I am making a generalization. Generalizations can be harmful or helpful. I think that we both bear some responsibility in the interpretation of the generalizations I make.
-   I admit it is difficult to not put a caveat or clarification after every statement when I write because I imagine objections to every thought. As a general rule for reading any work, I suggest you suspend your disbelief or skepticism. Take what inspires you and leave what you find to be silly. 
-   Pessimism is more often less useful than optimism.


-   This series of essays came together over more than 4 years of processing the ideas—maybe it is better that ideas progress in conversation with regular checkpoints of incomplete thought rather than in writing that is intended to be fully formed and stand on its own for years to come. Oh well, too late.


-  “Panaceas are dysfunctional” -Elinor Ostrom  
    -   Technology can't fix everything, but it can help some things
    -   Traditionalism can't fix everything, but it can help some things
    -   You can’t fix everything, but you can help some things


-   If it feels like I’m just repeating other people's ideas, I’m ok with that. There are a lot of ideas in the world & the easiest way for new people to hear old ideas is for new people to talk about them. These things take time, repetition & contemplation to wade through—just like a mantra or a creed 


-   Sometimes simplification is beneficial but sometimes ideas need room to breathe and roll around in our minds. In these cases, simplification is counterproductive.


-   I don't need to be useful to all people. To some people what I’m writing will be intolerably cliche and to others it will be indigestibly opaque, but I hope someone out there will find it valuable.
-   Links are sometimes giving credit for a specific reference but more often than that, are a broad gesture intended to get you thinking or simply be playful.
-   I find there are two kinds of dialogue: explicit and suggestive. Both give space to respond—the first in its divisiveness, the second in the space it creates. I often err towards explicitness but claim no correctness. Instead I'm simply hoping to start a conversation.



Thank you for being here!
