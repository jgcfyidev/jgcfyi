# Philosphy of Writing (and Disclaimers)

-   I concede that none of my writing can perfectly represent my thinking, or [truth](https://genius.com/Twain-in-the-high-of-the-morning-lyrics#:~:text=I%20recall%20that%20I%20used%20to%20despair%20at%20the%20lost%20chance%20of%20knowing%0AA%20much%20longed%20for%20beauty%0ABut%20now%20that%20I%20know%20it%27s%20my%20duty%20to%20love%20life%0ANot%20try%20and%20know%20life%0ATo%20show%20it%2Dto%20show%20I%20don%27t%20know%20yet%20I%20know%20that%20it%27s%20real) itself---nor do I possess some unique claim on truth, nor do I possess any particular ability to teach you anything.
-   I don’t think that what I’m writing about is the most important thing, or the only way to do things, it’s just what I happened to think about often enough to write about.
