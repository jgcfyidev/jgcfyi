## Community Memory

Why did bureaucratic efforts to stimulate economic growth instead
[devastate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp0Sxn42TGs)
one of the world\'s [largest
lakes](https://twitter.com/PatrickJBlum/status/1694115787890684407?s=20)
in less than fifty years? And how is it that 'uneducated' peasants have
collectively managed thriving irrigation systems for centuries in [New
Mexico](https://newmexiconomad.com/acequias/),
[Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subak_(irrigation)),
[Spain](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comunidad_de_regantes),
and
[India](https://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/pani-panchayat-model-groundwater-management-presentation-acwadam)?

The answer lies in the power of community memory---a shared and living
capacity for action grounded in relationship to our neighbors and our
place, from which emanates a joyful balance of agency and limits.

This first of six essays will explore why this equilibrium of
empowering agency and grounding limits is so important to sustaining
healthy places across generations. Subsequent sections will examine how
new technological approaches to collective coordination---from
participatory budgeting to local currencies---can reduce our reliance on
disempowering institutions and mature a community memory toward more
resilient home places. Foundational to this resilience is agency.

## Agency

[Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(philosophy))
is the capacity to
[shape](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6875140-the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world-is-that-it)
the world around (and
[within](https://twitter.com/cognazor/status/1599097257923514368))
us through action. The fields of psychology and mental health have well
established this power for self-determination as a [vital
factor](https://www.mindful.org/seven-ways-to-develop-personal-agency/#:~:text=People%20with%20low%20agency%20experience,and%20they%20act%20on%20impulse.)
for a healthy life. It allows us to engage more deeply in ways that
[improve](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dad2.12278)
[memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154531/),
[happiness](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/discontents),
and
[resilience](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263111355_Resilience_as_Agency)
in the face of challenges. Without agency,
[we](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04214-5#:~:text=We%20speculate%20that%20poor%20outcomes%20may%20be%20contributed%20to%20by%20patients%27%20lack%20of%20engagement%20in%20recovery%20due%20to%20poor%20agency%20and%20an%20external%20locus%20of%20control.)
[disengage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5002400/#:~:text=Research%20on%20patients%20with%20schizophrenia%20has%20confirmed%20that%20these%20individuals%20have%20agency%20processing%20problems.)
and are less successful in building healthy and sustainable habits.

While experienced by the
[individual](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1642350898071388160?s=20),
a rich and enduring faculty for self-determination can only be achieved
when we produce agency for each other in the mutual extension of trust
and empathy. This kind of relationally imbued self-efficacy has been
[shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3449358/#:~:text=Agency%20as%20discussed,by%20other%20people.)
to correlate with recovery from mental illness. Conversely, a [key
marker](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/coercive-control/)
of an
[unhealthy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5002400/#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20this%20reduction%20in%20sense%20of%20agency%20is%20associated%20with%20poor%20health%20and%20a%20reduction%20in%20quality%20of%20life)
relationship is one where a
[partner's](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/essays/from-domination-to-partnership)
right to self-determination is
[reduced](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768593/#:~:text=Campbell%20and%20Lewandowski,thrive%2C%20diarrhea)---and
yet we consider a lack of agency in making our communities to be normal
and even
[necessary](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=Brennan%20argues%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20entirely%20justifiable%20to%20limit%20the%20political%20power%20that%20the%20irrational%2C%20the%20ignorant%2C%20and%20the%20incompetent%20have%20over%20others.).

## Limits

Empathetic relationship is vital not only for agency-building, but also
the formation of mutual and responsive limits that ensure that the
exercise of agency does not compromise the long-term health of our
places. As technology broadens our
[propensity](https://newdesigncongress.org/en/about/#:~:text=Today%27s%20connected%20world%20exacerbates%20intolerable%20social%2C%20economic%2C%20political%20and%20ecological%20issues%20without%20accountability.)
for consumption, this relationship to limits becomes [increasingly
important](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/thought-limits-prodigal-age#:~:text=Those%20who%20live,of%20its%20people.).

It is not that natural limits have been transcended, but that technology
allows us to more easily externalize the effects of our consumption
beyond our home place.
[Agbogbloshie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agbogbloshie)
in Ghana, now [a global dumping
ground](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/america-e-waste-gps-tracker-tells-all-earthfix),
is one of many places that has seen its future shaped by the waste of
outsiders.

When we find ourselves in the habit of depending on 'somewhere else',
eventually [we
may](https://twitter.com/samdknowlton/status/1611073311580225536?s=20)
too find our homes
[implicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...)
in such an abstract system of economic relationship. Fostering agency in
a globally connected, technologically enabled society, then, depends on
our collective capability to
[conjure](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/mmt/#:~:text=But%20a%20monetary%20sovereign%20has%20to%20conjure%20its%20own%20source%20of%20discipline.)
a sufficient source of discipline. But where might it come from?

### Limits Derived in Institutions

In the absence (or doubt) of local capacity for disciplined stewardship,
[institutions](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html#:~:text=institution%20%E2%80%93%2D%20a%20relationship%20or%20shared%20endeavor%2C%20in%20which%20multiple%20people%20repeatedly%20participate%2C%20and%20featuring%20customs%2C%20rules%2C%20or%20other%20features%20which%20constrain%20or%20motivate%20participants%E2%80%99%20behaviors)
attempt control to produce moderation but achieve neither. Instead,
leaving us with a
[self-reinforcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law)
arms race of
[scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)
between abstract economies and any broad regulatory structure erected to
manage them.

As their
[scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) of
influence broadens, institutions reshape the places they attempt to
manage in their own image---reducing them to statistical averages and
summarizations derived in the postulations of people with more
credentials than context or
[affection](https://spiritoftheland.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/It-All-Turns-On-Affection-Wendell-Berry.pdf).
Despite their obsession with [absorbing
data](https://hbr.org/2012/04/good-data-wont-guarantee-good-decisions),
modern economies and their metastasizing institutions simply
[cannot](https://news.gallup.com/poll/403124/majority-continues-say-government-powerful.aspx)
produce enough understanding to reason about limits with meaningful
sensitivity.

### Limits Derived in Empathetic Relationships

Organizational structures anchored in affectionate dialogue provide a
more
[proprioceptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMEROPOK6v8)
framework for establishing sustainable limits than prosthetic
institutional decision-making processes. Only by such an embodied memory
of local placemaking traditions can we cultivate empathetic
understanding and respect for our constraints and attune ourselves to
the specific ecology of [our
place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS3-PffLKqM&t=1100s).

> Enduring structures of household and family life or the life of a
> community or the life of a country, cannot be formed except within
> limits. We must not outdistance local knowledge and affection.

## The Persistence of Place

Places embody our cumulative, [collective
memory](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/hawlbachsspace.pdf).
They are uniquely persistent in their effect on culture from generation
to generation, more
[enduring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Istanbul)
even than the organizational structures that manage them. The consequences of
poor caretaking are painfully clear in almost every American city today
as the same institutions that [gutted
downtowns](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8605917/highways-interstate-cities-history)
in service of
[highways](https://twitter.com/lennartnout/status/1449985513591558144)
now try to
[amend](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/27/climate/us-cities-highway-removal.html)
those mistakes 80 years later.

{{<image src="/media/image4.png" caption="Boston <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/OldPhotosInRealLife/comments/s3b3d0/boston_1938_vs_1969_before_the_big_dig/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>before and after</a> I-93 was built through the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_93#History:~:text=This%20new%20highway%20was%20greatly%20disliked%20by%20the%20citizens%20of%20the%20city%20because%20it%20cut%20the%20heart%20of%20the%20city%20in%20half%3B%20cast%20long%2C%20dreary%20shadows%3B%20and%20was%20an%20eyesore%20to%20the%20community.' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>middle of downtown</a> in the 1950s">}}

Decisions made about our places today will
[impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsT9V3WQiNA&t=383s)
many generations to come, and yet most Americans have no role to play in
building and maintaining their own neighborhoods.

### Experts and Consumers

The path of least resistance in American culture today is to be a
[consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyXfOc0n1LM&t=330s)
of place as
[product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWrG1KgBHdQ&t=585s),
just as we are consumers of [lawn
maintenance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160328005521/en/New-Research-Finds-Majority-of-Americans-Lack-Lawn-Care-Knowledge#:~:text=the%20majority%20of%20Americans%20lack%20basic%20knowledge%20about%20how%20to%20properly%20care%20for%20and%20maintain%20their%20lawns),
[home

and
[cooking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/05/the-slow-death-of-the-home-cooked-meal/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20all%20looking%20for%20someone%20else%20to%20cook%20for%20us%2C%22)
services. Our

invite us to be
[spectators](https://behavioralscientist.org/democracy-from-the-sidelines-how-u-s-politics-became-a-spectator-sport/)
more often than participants, and even the [parenting of our
children](https://www.todaysparent.com/blogs/opinion/outsourcing-parenting/)
is increasingly outsourced to experts. This pattern is reinforced in our
[increasingly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2012/01/31/the-end-of-a-job-as-we-know-it/?sh=403cb7eb16aa)

work lives, where power accrues to C-suite decision-makers removed from
the work. And so, in the making of our places, we too are often left as
passive speculators on the abilities of experts and a footnote in a
municipal report on \'community engagement\'.

Generations of
[planners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_planners)
creating *for* 'customers' has dampened our sense of self-efficacy in
placemaking. When the value of our places is determined by the
application of expert knowledge rather than by local interpersonal
cooperation in step with local ecology, less care and attention is
applied---especially as time distances planner from planned.

Today the power to change a neighborhood is primarily reserved for
'[visionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37zF36oq0jE)'
with enough [political
power](https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/the-federal-government-cares-too-much-about-state-dots-and-thats-a-problem),
[expertise](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/3/16/have-you-met-this-guy)

to navigate institutional
[processes](https://sf.curbed.com/2016/7/22/12259876/trulia-delays-red-tape-home-prices).
While such a dynamic expands the capacity for
[large-scale](https://www.rclco.com/publication/the-top-selling-master-planned-communities-of-2022/)
change, it hinders the ability of small actors to respond incrementally
to the problems they experience in their own homes and neighborhoods.

of central planning not only ends up making inaccurate generalizations
about the specific places it changes, but it also lulls those who it
plans for into a sleep-like dependence on external authority.

### Disengagement

Over time, not being trusted with community-building has made us
[apathetic](https://time.com/6160337/hard-to-care-about-anything/).
Engagement in local governance is at an [all-time
low](https://www.nationalcivicleague.org/ncr-article/increasing-voter-turnout-in-local-elections/#:~:text=The%20turnout%20for%20local%20elections%20is%20historically%20both%20low%20and%20less%20representative%20of%20community%20demographics.)
and it is now common for people to live without any connection to their
[neighbors](https://qz.com/916801/americans-dont-know-their-neighbors-anymore-and-thats-bad-for-the-future-of-democracy),
[neighborhoods](https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2017/10/10/don-know-our-neighbors-anymore-here-what-that-costs/m9sTUVbmi3XFfxRN96Ft9M/story.html),
or [local
history](https://medium.com/new-american-history/all-history-is-local-be096696291b#:~:text=Though%20I%20grew,anywhere%20else%20around.).
Our habit of
[consuming](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/are-we-still-thinking#:~:text=Mass%20media%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8Aprint,have%20conversations%20with.)
has rendered us increasingly willing to depend on outsourced management
of our places, whose
[expertise](https://www.reddit.com/r/OceanGateTitan/comments/14gc35d/used_carbon_fiber_was_proud_of_it/)
we hope can absolve us of any
[obligation](https://aeon.co/essays/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-is-a-false-and-dangerous-myth)
for collaborative stewardship and affection.

This craving for absolution is no surprise given the well-studied
[paradox of
choice](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice),
which
[argues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice)
that the glut of possible paths available to us in modern society is a
major source of anxiety and
[fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue).
When modes of [making a
living](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/20-most-popular-jobs-for-college-graduates/)
no longer require local knowledge, schools are willing to [teach
anything](https://www.malibumakos.com/pepperdine-university-surf-class/)
as long as you pay, and all work can be done remotely, we come under the
weight of choosing our life from a buffet of all possible
happinesses---and find none.

Generational
[memory](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/19/11870#:~:text=Unlike%20historical%20memory%E2%80%94a%20collection,memory%20alive%E2%80%9D%20%5B32%5D.),
tradition, and a connection to our home places are exactly the things
that have traditionally produced lighter individual burdens of choice in
the past---but ironically, they themselves are now
[outsourced](https://folklife.si.edu/) to the
institutional structures whose [depersonalizing
abstractions](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/pages/culture)
make them impotent.

The longer our apathetic dependence on distant and opaque systems of
organization goes on, the more out of tune we become with traditions of
placemaking that have grown alongside the specific ecology of our place.
Eventually, our
[collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_memory)
[memory
loss](https://reedquest.org/2023/09/15/review-of-typhoons-offerings-an-existential-narrative-by-a-portland-band/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20a%20record,from%20violence/oblivion%3F%E2%80%9D)
can render these traditions unsalvageable--shifting our connection with
extractive economies from a convenient way to raise 'standards of
living' to a dangerous dependence on fragile
[gentrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AckNxh1NZY&t=146s)
[systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290557797_Global_supply_chains_disasters_and_externalities_How_complex_supply_networks_create_damaging_externalities_and_its_consequences)
beyond local control.

{{<image src="/media/image25.png">}}


This pattern is evident in many rural American communities, where
nonlocal retailers like
[Walmart](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wal-Mart%27s+war+on+Main+Street.-a015890049)
and [Dollar
General](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/13/dollar-general-walmart-buhler-haven-kansas)
initially disrupted local economies, replacing groups of locally owned
businesses with a single store. Over time, communities have grown
reliant on these corporations for jobs and access to food, only to again
see
[disruption](https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/handle/10355/88143)
when the retailers choose to
[close](https://youtu.be/p3O6bKdPLbw?t=471) or move.

## Catalysts of Change in a Society Managed at Scale

For most communities defined by
[numbing](https://www.vox.com/explainers/2017/7/19/15925506/psychic-numbing-paul-slovic-apathy),
impersonal economies managed by large institutions, the fog of our
listlessness only
[lifts](https://youtu.be/Lf9yoxqt9yw?t=140) when something
breaks.

Such shock events provide space to reevaluate and engage with the deeper
structure of society. Because incumbent institutions and economic
relationships adapt slowly to these new realities, individuals and small
communities find themselves [more
capable](https://www.goodai.com/a-conversation-with-michael-levin/#:~:text=So%20stress%20is%20part%20of%20that%20glue%20that%20binds%20these%20collective%20agents%20together.)
and ready to implement solutions independently, without oversight
or permission. These interventions ultimately prove to be a catalyst of
longer-term change---as was apparent in the wake of
[COVID-19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20303600),
which invited changes not just in [remote
work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508142/),
but also
[healthcare](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/6921_CHS-Virtual-work/DI_CHS-virtual-work.pdf),
[public
space](https://crosscut.com/opinion/2021/07/how-pandemic-made-us-rethink-community-spaces),
[transportation](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/01/27/study-covid-era-pop-up-bike-lanes-increase-cycling-trips-up-to-48/),
[outdoor
dining](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/even-post-covid-outdoor-dining-should-keep-going-our-staid-ncna1263352),
[supply
chains](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rethinking-global-supply-chain-model-by-diane-coyle-2022-06),
and more.

This phenomenon can also often be observed after a [pedestrian
death](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/dangerous-by-design/),
often the only time when communities sufficiently mobilize to prioritize
safer transportation infrastructure. In these instances, citizens take
[matters into their own
hands](https://ctexaminer.com/2023/01/03/stamford-moves-ahead-with-tactical-urbanism-solutions-for-pedestrian-deaths/)
or local [demands for

and other DIY urbanism is further evidence of this impulse.

Despite positive outcomes from [wake-up

events, we shouldn\'t depend on pandemics and pedestrian deaths to drive
positive change in society. If we embrace new (and

## Where Do We Start?

The study of long-sustained water and
[forest](http://www.pacificbio.org/initiatives/fire/fire_ecology.html)
management systems teaches us that building resilient places protected
from catastrophe requires iterative and ongoing management in tune
with local ecology. Just as [prescribed
burns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E542gY7uR0s) are
often carried out on foot at a careful pace to prevent larger disasters,
we must cultivate smaller-scale organizational and economic structures
that empower local people to maintain their specific place with care and
affection. Only then can we begin the work of weaving a dynamic,
resilient society of our home places.
