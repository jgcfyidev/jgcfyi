<h1>Community Memory</h1>
<h5 style="margin:0;">A Framework for Building Resilient Communities <br> Anchored in Relationship and Empowered by Collaborative Technology</h5>


<mark class="blurb">This six-part series will examine how new organizational and
technological approaches to collaborative coordination can support a
'community memory' grounded in affectionate relationship to each other
and our places over generations. These locally derived traditions of
placemaking can help build more resilient communities and reduce our
reliance on disempowering institutions.</blurb>

###### 1. [**Relationship**](/1-relationship)

Despite the proliferation of impersonal organizational structures and
abstract global economies, only the mutual extension of
trust---grounded in affection for our home places---can foster
traditions of placemaking strong enough to steward our communities
sustainably through generations.

###### 2.  [**Agency**](/2-agency)

Life-giving agency must be established through the kind of
spontaneous, trust-filled relationship that distant institutions are
incapable of. Innovative organizational structures, in rhythm with
natural ecologies, can scaffold these relationships into a more
resilient organizational mycelium in support of our home places. 

###### 3. [**Limits**](/3-limits)

As globalized economies accumulate hidden existential debts,
institutions seeking to control for risk instead reinforce our
trajectory. Affectionate and empathetic relationship with the people
and places around us can help more effectively build resilience and
diffuse these risks. 

###### 4. [**Time**](/4-time)

Agency and limits both are strongly supported by traditions of
generational knowledge transfer, rooted in specific place. Equilibrial
investment and draw from local resources over generations grounds a
community in time and place, giving joy in the present and assurance
of the future. 

###### 5. [**Tools**](/5-tools)

Our tools and technologies amplify our habits of relating to each
other, our places, our organizational systems, and even time. More
collaborative computing architectures can help us shed the prosthesis
of institutional control and rebuild the locally-derived competency
necessary to steward our places through generations. 

###### 6. [**Action**](/6-action)

Capable new tools for collaborative action are poised to shift
sovereignty back to small communities at more appropriate fidelity of
empowered placemaking. Together, these tools can help us build a
persistent community memory capable of carrying our places forward
with vitality.
