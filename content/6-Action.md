For an enduring community memory to sustain us, we must act to
perpetuate it. The most important of such acts are simple: to listen to
a friend or plant a tree. Still, there are some ways that community
computing can help us grow in deeper relationship to our neighbors and
our place. So finally, let's get into some specific near-term use cases
for these technologies.

The following discussion should be viewed as a

of these systems means that specific uses cannot be prescribed or
predicted very far in advance.

## Digital Identity
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 16px;"><i>And other foundations for digital governance</i> </p>

Establishing a reliable digital identity system has been lauded as
something of a technological holy grail, unlocking new connections
between the digital and physical. Concerningly, most commonly
[imagined](https://worldcoin.org/) identity architectures
pass through large
[institutions](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_A_Blueprint_for_Digital_Identity.pdf)
or
[corporations](https://www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/wp-content/uploads/smart-city-digital-id-products.pdf).
A state-organized digital identity system, integrated with a
state-managed payment platform, powered by a
<a href="https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/mmt/#:~:text=monetary%20revolution%20afoot.-,Monetary%20Sovereignty,-At%20the%20heart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sovereign</a>
state currency would be the perfect kind of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228170331/https://www.state.gov/guiding-principles-on-government-use-of-surveillance-technologies/#:~:text=Surveillance%20technologies%20can%20be%20important%20tools%20for%20protecting%20national%20security%20and%20public%20safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveillance state</a>
panopticon.

As an alternative, several kinds of '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>self-sovereign (digital)
identity</a>'
(SSI) systems have been
[proposed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04911) to give
individuals autonomy and authority over how their identity and
accompanying data is used and verified. There are plenty of difficult
compromises to work through before we get to self-sovereignty,
though---such as, if the data management is truly self-sovereign, then
who is establishing and verifying its truth?

Even while considering
[the](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/)
[many](https://www.brightid.org/)
[worthwhile](https://www.civic.com/)
[efforts](https://x.com/_daecae/status/1938919188363427869)

[universal digital identity
systems](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/digital-identity/),
it is important to remember that identity has historically been
[constructed](https://repository.law.umich.edu/mlr_online/vol117/iss1/9/)
through
[*relationship*](https://www.inkandswitch.com/backchannel/)
at the
[local](https://thinkingcity.org/2018/07/24/how-does-place-shape-who-we-are/)
level. And so, there is plenty of room
[today](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)
for iterative and informal
[experiments](https://spritely.institute/) in
[*community*](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/social-identity/)-sovereign
identity in our home places---experiments that may help to
<a href="https://otherinter.net/research/three-body-problem/#:~:text=From%20this%20vantage,society%20unto%20itself." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mature</a>
innovations in community computing, which have until now been used
mostly for the speculative games of technologists.

{{<image src="/media/image18.png" caption="Our first conception of identity is not given by an institution, but formed in relationship with the people and place around us.<a href='https://jenikirbyhistory.getarchive.net/media/family-farm-sunset-people-b1831e' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>(source)</a>">}}

### Reputation Systems

One such category of informal social identity is that of reputation
systems. Organizations like
[Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/intro-to-passport)
and [Lens](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/what-is-lens) are
working to compile and verify users' disparate online identities into
<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-does-zero-knowledge-proof-authentication-help-create-a-portable-digital-identity-solution#:~:text=Identity%20portability%20refers%20to%20the%20ability%20of%20users%20to%20generate%20a%20single%20set%20of%20digital%20ID%20credentials%20usable%20across%20multiple%20platforms." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portable</a>
social graphs. These systems are useful because they can aggregate
informal markers of identity like a username, ownership of a [digital
collectible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token),
[proof of attendance](https://poap.xyz/), or even simply
control of an [ethereum address](https://login.xyz/).

Building reputation as an accumulation of iterative action is a socially
intuitive way to establish digital identity---and a more relational
component of a locally sovereign web than monolithic state or
[institution-based](https://worldcoin.org/) identity
systems. Immutable blockchains
[stand](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)
both to provide the infrastructure and cultural support for the
implementation of these architectures. Because they aren't controlled by
a centralized entity that may someday [go
away](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/geocities-dies-in-march-2019-and-with-it-a-piece-of-internet-history/),
they are more
[permanent](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)
and portable than any more self-contained identity solution.

### Digital Hardness

Privacy, combined with digital
<a href="https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0#:~:text=Recently%2C%20we%E2%80%99ve%20invented%20a%20new%20way%20to%20create%20hardness%3A%20blockchains.%20Using%20an%20elegant%20combination%20of%20cryptography%2C%20networked%20software%2C%20and%20commoditized%20human%20incentives%2C%20we%20are%20able%20to%20create%20software%20and%20digital%20records%20that%20have%20a%20degree%20of%20permanence." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardness</a>
[derived in
blockchains](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-dawn-of-trustworthy-computing.html),
community
[verification](https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-builds-passport-on-ceramic/),
and [social
recovery](https://www.argent.xyz/learn/what-is-social-recovery/)
of sovereign accounts could allow us to trust digital information and
relationships much more than we do today.

Today formal processes for local representation rely on slow, in-person
governance mechanisms. A reliable digital identity structure would make
online feedback as real and credible as in-person feedback, and invite
more
[responsive](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/towards-real-time-governance-using-digital-feedback-improve-service-voice)
and dynamic governance---for both municipalities and more informal
organizations. It is easy to imagine that proof of
[attendance](https://poap.xyz/how-to-use-poap) to
neighborhood meetings, accumulated on-chain over time could become an
important part of local identity and be used to [help
trust](https://litgateway.com/apps/zoom) online actions.

As AI makes everything [less
believable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/17/ai-fake-news-misinformation/),
systems that rely on interpersonal relationship grounded in a physical
place may be the *only* digital identity systems that prevail.

### First Steps

So, if we are to work ourselves iteratively toward 'hard' online
reputation systems, we should start with the basics. The first step
toward aggregated identity is simply somewhere for an identity to
accumulate to. User controlled accounts (<a href="https://info.etherscan.com/what-is-an-ethereum-address/" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>addresses</a>)
are foundational to blockchain architecture, and systems like [Ethereum
Name Service](https://docs.ens.domains/) (ENS) apply human
readable naming systems to those accounts. These addresses can hold
assets from [US dollars](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)
to [magazine subscriptions](https://x.com/dirtyverse/status/1615426255821889537)
and prove [legal](https://otoco.io/)
[incorporation](https://docs.wrappr.wtf/get-started/what/#what-is-wrappr)
of a company.

Compared with the norm of one-account-per-website, such a portable
account system makes access more flexible for users while lifting the
burden of account management from creators. This infrastructural
cornerstone of community computers can be used to manage access to
governance forms and other forms of digital collaboration. With more
opportunities for direct
<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/01/31/end.html#:~:text=this%20stack%20is-,democratic%20governance%20technology,-%3A%20tools%20for%20people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">governance</a> ,
these tools may start to shift power dynamics in the management of our
places.

the distinctions between neighborhood Facebook and Nextdoor groups and

city governance. These tools can
[support](https://medium.com/block-science/computer-aided-governance-cag-a-revolution-in-automated-decision-support-systems-9faa009e57a2)
and expand the viability of existing, but limited physical experiments
in [small-scale
sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation)---ranging
from the [reclamation of indigenous land
tenure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganienkeh) to the
more playful communities of
[Užupis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C5%BEupis) and
[Freetown
Christiania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania).

While determined communities will always find creative ways to establish
local agency, community computers can provide an accessible,
transferable infrastructure for self-organization that allows these
models to spread more widely. A proliferation of more locally capable
communities, interconnected by shared organizational infrastructure
facilitates the incorporation of local and regional relationships into
the kind of broad polycentric structures that Elinor Ostrom and Gandhi
envisioned for a healthy society. Compared with fragile top-down
structures, this locally emanating organizational superstructure is
patterned for resilience.

### Pathways To Shared Power

There is a paradoxical push and pull for decision-makers in cities.
While municipalities aim to create a great place for their residents,
they often exclude them from improvement efforts because the unity of
vision and efficiency of central planning is too appealing. In the minds
of those bureaucrats who think highly of their ability to plan for the
future, there is [no safe
way](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/local-government-community-input-housing-public-transportation/629625/)
to give up their power to plan for others.

Community computers can help bridge this gap between representatives and
represented---first by making accounting and decision-making more
public. Once on-chain, pathways open for more direct ownership and
control to be handed over iteratively.

### Digital Structures for Governance of Physical Space

Many digital communities already harness platforms like
[Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
and [Canny](https://canny.io/) to allow for simple and
collaborative co-creation of functional software and websites. Because
of crypto's account-based foundation, a diverse set of tools of
[collaboration](https://web.archive.org/web/20230126082949/https://subconscious.network/)
[exist](https://www.kolektivo.network/)
[today](https://docs.fileverse.io/about),
[ready](https://twitter.com/metagov_project/status/1580231463353450500)
to be used similarly in our home places. With more trustworthy systems
of digital identity, we might be able to make GitHub-style pull requests
on [planning
documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_planning)
and have our ideas approved with enough community support, bypassing
institutional delay.

### Voting

Voting is the bedrock of collaborative governance in most modern
societies. While digital voting has long loomed as one of the potential
unlocks of mature digital identity systems, even in their absence
blockchains are enabling novel forms of voting. Prominent
[on-chain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chain-transactions-cryptocurrency.asp)
voting tools include
[Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.box/#welcome-to-snapshot),
[Tally](https://docs.tally.xyz/knowledge-base/tally),
[Aragon](https://aragon.org/), and
[Coordinape](https://about.coordinape.com/).

In the world of [decentralized
finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance),
blockchain protocols are often managed with governance by
<a href="https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/process#:~:text=Delegation%3A%20ENS%20holders%20cannot%20vote%20or%20create%20proposals%20until%20they%20delegate%20their%20voting%20rights%20to%20an%20address.%20Delegation%20can%20be%20given%20to%20one%20address%20at%20a%20time%2C%20including%20the%20holder%E2%80%99s%20own%20address.%20Note%20that%20delegation%20does%20not%20lock%20tokens%3B%20it%20simply%20adds%20votes%20to%20the%20chosen%20delegation%20address." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delegation</a>,
in the tradition of [liquid
democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy).
Delegated voting power can be revoked or changed in real time, and
individuals are free to vote independently if they choose. In contrast
to more formally recognized government representatives in our real world
communities, this structure allows involved and interested members to
gain influence in the governance of their community without as clear of
a line drawn between represented and representative.

[Conviction
voting](https://medium.com/commonsstack/conviction-voting-f6f83a5d392a)
is another innovation enabled by community computers. In this model
votes are continuous and can be changed at any time, but grow stronger
in weight over time if they are not changed. The ability for signals and
support for initiatives to rebalance over time creates a more active and
accountable model of governance than one-time votes on issues, and the
consideration of conviction over time provides stability.

These and other exciting [new
experiments](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-voting/)
promise to <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/10/31/cities.html#:~:text=Experiment%20%232%3A%20more%20radical%20and%20participatory%20forms%20of%20governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open doors</a>
for novel consensus formation in our communities by rounding the hard
edges of one-time voting, allowing residents to participate more
actively in governance of local issues in real-time.

### Participatory Budgeting and Public Goods

Blockchains don't just serve as trustworthy record keeping
infrastructure for identity and voting, they introduce natively digital
value transmission. Combined with their
<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/10/31/cities.html#:~:text=One%20simple%20idea,payments%20and%20salaries." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transparency</a>
and potential for collaboration, they give us a pathway to collectively
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser#:~:text=root%20is%20the%20conventional%20name%20of%20the%20user%20who%20has%20all%20rights%20or%20permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directly</a>
manage the budgeting and funding mechanisms of our jurisdiction or
organization.

Today, some of the most important <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#ledgers-bitcoin-blockchains:~:text=goes%20like%20this%3A-,ii.%20DAOs,-I%20should%20mention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on-chain organizations</a>
(DAOs), such as
[MakerDAO](https://dune.com/sportreally/makerdao-dashboard), are
already completely

in real-time with governance that happens
[on-chain](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/voting-in-makerdao/on-chain-governance),
meaning votes are capable of executing their results immediately. In the
same way, there is the potential for city budgets to be managed directly
and transparently on-chain. For smaller communities willing to
experiment, these new tools are available even today. Their experiments
can open doorways for larger communities, more burdened by the
bureaucracy of yesterday's organizational infrastructure.

Giving constituents more direct say over where government money is spent
is not [a new
idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_budgeting#History).
[Participatory
budgeting](https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/what-can-1.3-million-accomplish-nyc-residents-are-getting-a-say)
is well-loved by advocates of more representative governance, but it is
also historically difficult to administer---often introducing the need
for more government intermediation instead of less. Community computing
[can help](https://zine.zora.co/budgeting-for-all)
real-world communities address these organizational hurdles.

If these tools for collective management of public money are properly
integrated with local tax and budgeting agencies, citizens could even be
given direct power over a certain percentage of their own property tax
or sales tax dollars---further engaging citizens in co-creation. Money
could be placed in something like a [donor-advised
fund](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/donor-advised-funds),
except with the local municipality as the sponsoring organization and
the citizen as the advisor for its destination.
[Endaoment](https://endaoment.org/) is an organization
already taking advantage of the opportunity for collective management of
money in the world of traditional donor advised funds.

Another experimental mechanism for more participatory financing is that
of [retroactive public goods
funding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2cqeazKJoESAvRiX8ZUuaoxRNwAYw24G3nS).
In such a system, the value of services provided by an individual or
group is estimated and paid for by participants after its
implementation. Though not realistic for every endeavor, this structure
may push public projects to be more iterative and relational, serving as
a possible antidote to unaccountable [accumulation of
debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SLGSDODNS) that is
our
[habit](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/8/22/the-more-we-grow-the-poorer-we-become)
for large-scale projects today. Over time, this structure can invite
individuals and non-government entities to build their own capacity for
placemaking, releasing the local government from being the only party
responsible for the funding of [public
goods](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3337).

### New Funding Mechanisms

Beyond empowering communities to be in more direct relationship with
publicly managed money, new on-chain funding infrastructure promises
communities more opportunities for direct relationship with the
businesses that serve them.

Innovative small businesses have been notoriously difficult to finance
with bank-held debt, but had few historical alternatives. A revolution
in [crowdfunding](https://opencollective.com/) and
crowdlending for [thoughtful real estate
investment](https://www.smallchange.co/), [regenerative
farming](https://gosteward.com/about), and [community
projects](https://ioby.org/about) reveals a strong desire
for novel funding infrastructure.

Opportunities for more relational local economies don't end with simple
crowdfunding. [Use-credit
obligations](https://www.lowimpact.org/categories/use-credit-obligations)
allow businesses to exchange '<a href="https://www.lowimpact.org/categories/use-credit-obligations#:~:text=Deli%20owner%20Frank%20Tortoriello%20wanted%20to%20move%20his%20deli%20to%20a%20new%20premises%20in%20Great%20Barrington%2C%20Massachussetts%2C%20in%201989%2C%20but%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20obtain%20a%20bank%20loan.%20He%20issued%20%E2%80%98deli%20dollars%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%93%20vouchers%20for%20future%20produce%20that%20were%20a%20roaring%20success%2C%20and%20allowed%20him%20to%20make%20the%20move." target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>coupons</a>'
for future goods or services for money today, directly with customers.
[Community supported
agriculture](https://rodaleinstitute.org/blog/the-history-of-community-supported-agriculture/)
(CSA) allows the same type of relationship between farmers and community
members. While these are [not
new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHwZojqJBFE) concepts,
they do stand to be uniquely invigorated by the interoperability,
autonomy and verifiability that blockchains offer.

{{<image src="/media/image27.jpg" caption="Berkshire Farm Preserve Notes were jointly issued by two Great Barrington farms in 1991, The Corn Crib and Taft Farm, to finance start-up in the spring, and could be redeemed once produce was ready to be harvested. — <a href='https://centerforneweconomics.org/apply/local-currencies-program/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Center for New Economics</a>">}}

Today, blockchain-based tools like
[Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/) provide simple
infrastructure for crowdfunding and distributing shared ownership over
digital property. [Gitcoin Grants
Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack) allows users to
coordinate community-driven grants funding.
[Clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/about) allows participants
to crowdfund public goods with the aid of [quadratic
funding](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html),
where philanthropic individuals or organizations contribute to a
matching pool that is dispersed in higher proportion to causes with more
individual donors.

## Collective Ownership and Action

Collective ownership and stewardship of place has been practiced in
[healthy](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1194)
[communities](https://fundus-agricultura.wiki/?p=2714&lang=en)
[throughout](https://www.britannica.com/topic/mir-Russian-community)
[history](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2641287), working
best when it is strongly supported by culture and tradition. In
contrast, individual ownership is often the only legally and culturally
supported mode of ownership today.

Though programmable money does allow the possibility of a more
quantified and financialized society, it also provides infrastructure for
collaborative, common ownership. In fact, tools for shared ownership and
action have been core to blockchains
[since](https://blog.coinfund.io/community-ownership-as-a-blockchain-adoption-model-71a87f167de2)
[the
beginning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)).
It is up to us to use these tools to counter the encroachment of
[atomizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpBOgh2zxtE)
property modalities upon remaining traditions of mutual support and
stewardship.

[Recent efforts to
revive](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-emerging-solidarity-economy-a-primer-on-community-ownership-of-real-estate/)
collaborative ownership structures in more individually focused cultures
include models like [land
banks](https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/land-banks-land-trusts-blight),
[community land
trusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_land_trust#Dual_ownership),
and
[cooperatives](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4302681).
A digital commons for iterating and sharing these structures, supported
by [community
computing](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-property/),
gives earnest communities a
<a href="https://publicinfrastructure.org/2023/03/29/the-three-legged-stool/#:~:text=Third%2C%20we%20introduce,and%20terrorist%20content." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turnkey</a>
organizational
[infrastructure](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/dagon/blob/main/Dagon.pdf)
complete with identity, voting and financing pathways---interoperable
with their neighbors yet flexible enough to iterate over time.
Eventually, blockchain-based [smart
contracts](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/05/26/an-introduction-to-smart-contracts-and-their-potential-and-inherent-limitations/)
may be recognized as able to convey reliable and trustworthy ownership
structures independent of state recognition entirely.

### Community Ownership of Public Land

Champions of local sovereignty have the opportunity to integrate long
standing traditions of collective land management practiced from
[Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_forestry_in_Nepal)
to [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejido) with
emerging digital commons to mature these practices in their own
communities. While today these traditions are strongest in community
forestry, their lessons apply more broadly. Large numbers of vacant
properties sit idle across America in <a href="https://citymonitor.ai/government/what-is-a-land-bank#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIn%20Pittsburgh%2C%20you,the%20local%20councilperson.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">city-owned land banks</a>,
often locked behind the tight control of city-councils. Community
computing infrastructure gives cities the tools to have these properties
managed directly by local residents.

When integrated with digital identity systems, voting shares in publicly
owned lands could be distributed directly to local residents or
neighborhood groups.
[Multisignature](https://ethereum.org/gl/developers/docs/smart-contracts/#multisig)
smart contracts and other on-chain [legal
innovations](https://lexdao.org/) already exist for the
cooperative management of sensitive and valuable property and could be
applied in this case to collectively control shared resources with
transparency and verifiability.

### Common Ownership of Housing

Today, volatile housing markets and a crisis of affordability have led
to a call for new approaches to housing accessibility in our
communities. These calls have been answered by pushes toward shared
ownership and collective management---from
[common](https://centerforneweconomics.org/apply/community-land-trust-program/)
[land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plh-sArBKFk) under
private housing to collective funding of
[construction](https://metropolismag.com/projects/dont-call-it-a-commune-inside-berlin-radical-cohousing-project/).

<br>

{{<image src="/media/image23.png" caption="<a href='https://rocusa.org/whats-a-roc/what-is-a-roc-how-is-it-different/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Resident-owned</a> <a href='https://www.floridamfghome.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>mobile-home</a> communities are one of the more common forms of cooperative ownership structures in America today.">}}

While encouraging, these efforts are still sparse and often dependent on
<a href="https://metropolismag.com/projects/dont-call-it-a-commune-inside-berlin-radical-cohousing-project/#:~:text=The%20architect%2Dled%2C%20collectively%20funded%20R50%20Baugruppen%20project%20in%20Berlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">professionals</a>
with personal skin in the game or dedicated and supportive
[non-profits](https://rocusa.org/about-roc-usa/).
Plug-and-play blockchain
[infrastructure](https://medium.com/lexdaoism/when-daos-get-real-managing-real-property-on-a-blockchain-83f43f55da53)
for such management can make these shared-ownership models more
accessible. Prepaid rent vouchers for financing housing (<a href="https://www.lowimpact.org/categories/housing-commons#:~:text=comments%20section%20below.-,Rent%2Dcredit%20obligations,-It%20might%20be" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>rent-credit obligations</a>)
are one strategy that stand to become much simpler for communities to
manage on their own.

Such experiments may be appealing first to nonprofits like Habitat for
Humanity, who already own groups of homes, but eventually shared
ownership could appeal to motivated neighborhood groups or even friend
groups. Once the infrastructure for shared housing ownership is
established, more mature groups may expand to function like more formal
jurisdictions to manage public infrastructure like roads, utilities and
internet.

### On-chain Tools

Tools for collective governance of shared assets are already being
actively used and maintained on-chain.
[NFTX](https://docs.nftx.io/), is a protocol which allows
[non-fungible
tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)
(NFTs) to be deposited in exchange for a share of collectively deposited
assets. While used to create more liquid markets today, this
infrastructure for collectivizing ownership and action can also be used
in our neighborhoods. Tools like <a href="https://party.mirror.xyz/dee_r_PxRflk6CYAMNI98PGILQ5RL95E9WN4Iw9kDKc#:~:text=We%20believe%20the%20same%20leaps%20forward%20that%20trustless%20protocols%20have%20brought%20to%20financial%20primitives%20can%20be%20brought%20to%20groups%20of%20people%20acting%20in%20coordination%2C%20and%20that%20this%20will%20be%20a%20core%20unlock%20for%20Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Party Protocol</a>
are being developed for collaborative governance of shared digital
assets. Groups like [Partial Common
Ownership](https://partialcommonownership.com/) are
exploring blockchain-based structures for '<a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-property/" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>plural property</a>'
in the physical world, showing the ability of flexible smart contract
systems to aid in
<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/10/31/cities.html#:~:text=Experiment%20%232%3A%20more%20radical%20and%20participatory%20forms%20of%20governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiments</a>
with new ownership structures, such as the <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/harberger-taxes-on-ethereum#:~:text=Harberger%20Taxes%20consists,their%20own%20price." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harberger tax</a>
or [Georgist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism) land
tax systems.

### New Experiments in Knowledge Distribution

Of course, innovation in collective action and ownership is not limited
to physical property. New infrastructure for distributing knowledge and
design globally can serve as a valuable resource for empowering the
average citizen to take iterative action and make their ideas a reality
in their home place. In the tradition of <a href="http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/about/#:~:text=Tactical%20Urbanism%20is%20all%20about,to%20catalyze%20long%2Dterm%20change." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tactical urbanism</a> ,
this capacity for action can reduce local dependence on outside (<a href="https://smartenoughcity.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/yvyv9j2i/release/1#:~:text=opaque%2C%20often%20proprietary%2C%20algorithms%20to%20make%20life%2Daltering%20decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sometimes predatory</a>)
service providers for cities.

A robust interoperable infrastructure for the
[distribution](https://manifold.xyz/) and
[management](https://highlight.xyz/about) of [digital
property](https://twitter.com/metalabel_/status/1760361580657877361)
already exists to support the world of digital art. Meanwhile,
marketplaces and
[commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production)
for [3D
printing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49583842_3-D_Printing_of_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technologies_for_Self-Directed_Sustainable_Development),
[CNC](https://www.betterblock.org/wikiblock), and
[more](https://www.instructables.com/) are emerging, but
still fragmented.

Marketplaces and [payment](https://splits.org/) rails
native to crypto networks, made available to local socially-minded
[entrepreneurs](https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/startup/what-is-social-entrepreneurship)
or
[cooperatives](https://web.archive.org/web/20230911094114/https://fairworldproject.org/co-operatives-the-heart-and-soul-of-the-fair-trade-movement/)
could help to proliferate robust
[resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_appropriate_technology)
[libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOYa3YzVtyk)
for locally empowered placemaking. Participation could be
[incentivized](https://twitter.com/teaprotocol) through
on-chain royalties,
[subscription](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/204606315-What-is-Patreon)

like-minded communities.

Such libraries and marketplaces could make

approved implementations from these design libraries could reduce the

### Social Coordination

Beyond physical and digital ownership, blockchains can support broader
social coordination as well. One example
[discussed](https://theblockchainsocialist.com/talking-politics-with-vitalik-buterin-part-2/)
by [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.eth.limo/) is the
decentralized coordination of a conference. In this example, like-minded
people can place a deposit into a smart contract along with a preference
for a location. Once a threshold of deposits with a matching location is
met, money would be placed in a treasury and collectively managed by the
participants to coordinate the conference. Such a mechanism could
catalyze local neighborhood events or crowdfunded civic projects,
similar to existing organizations like
[Ioby](https://ioby.org/about). This kind of opt-in
funding helps present a middle way between 'messy' decentralized
dialogue-based coordination, and 'speed-optimized' centralized control
that modern municipal governments often default to.

## Money

Finally, we cannot discuss
crypto<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/12/05/excited.html#:~:text=1.%20Money%3A%20the%20first%20and%20still%20most%20important%20app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currency</a>
without discussing its role as money. The shape of our economies
dictates so much of
[institutional](https://twitter.com/drumm_colin/status/1588320762607259648)
and social form that money cannot be ignored when considering the health
of physical communities.

### Universal Money

Since [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) arrived
in 2009, there have been many concurrent blockchain-based experiments in
what a state-independent universal money can be, including
<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/12/05/excited.html#:~:text=1.-,Money,-%3A%20the%20first%20and" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a>
(serving as a specific currency for
<a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/03/ethereum-blockspace-who-gets-what-and-why#:~:text=Blockspace%20is%20the%20commodity%20that%20powers%20the%20heartbeats%20of%20all%20cryptocurrency%20networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blockspace</a>),
[DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#introduction) (a
<a href="https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#the-dai-stablecoin:~:text=Every%20Dai%20in%20circulation%20is%20directly%20backed%20by%20excess%20collateral%2C%20meaning%20that%20the%20value%20of%20the%20collateral%20is%20higher%20than%20the%20value%20of%20the%20Dai%20debt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collateral-backed</a>
currency that seeks to peg itself to the US Dollar), and
[RAI](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd)
(an experimental stable asset without a peg at all). Demand for global
money is not going away, and many interesting experiments with this goal
are [still developing](https://web.archive.org/web/20240226011549/http://bank.dev/).

Of course, [states
themselves](https://www.federalreserve.gov/cbdc-faqs.htm)
are exploring how they might manage their own digital currencies. Today
most dollars are
<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/Banks#:~:text=Banks%20also%20create%20money." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created</a>
by [local
banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzE038REw2k), and so
it follows that new experiments in banks issuing their own [money
on-chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin) are
consequential for our monetary system. One such experiment, a consortium
of banks called [USDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20250304002651/https://www.usdfconsortium.com/),
proposes to produce an interoperable money derived from deposits in its
member banks. This, and [other
experiments](https://blockworks.co/news/wyoming-could-be-first-us-state-to-issue-official-stablecoin),
may provide 'state approved'
[alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking)
to
[central-bank](https://hbr.org/2021/10/what-if-central-banks-issued-digital-currency)-issued
money.

### Local Money

Beyond the pursuit of universal or national money, there is a [long
history](https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/stanch-the-bleeding-from-local-and)
of modern (and
<a href="https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/properties-of-money/#:~:text=For%20a%20phenomenal%20review%20of%20money%E2%80%99s%20historical%20plurality%2C%20see%20Akinobu%20Kuroda%E2%80%99s%20A%20Global%20History%20of%20Money." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">premodern</a>)
[local](https://centerforneweconomics.org/apply/local-currencies-program/localcurrenciesdirectory/#map)
currencies that becomes increasingly relevant as interoperable,
trustworthy community computing systems mature.

Local currencies aim to foster economic relationship within a geographic
area, with motivations from building economic mindfulness to steadying
local economies in times of national
[instability](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-07/a-depression-era-idea-gets-a-new-look-local-money).
Today many communities with a desire for more <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7513.html#:~:text=But%20that%20achievement,a%20mere%20transaction." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relational and less abstract</a>
economies, treating money as a social tool, remain committed to
sustaining and maturing [local
currencies](https://centerforneweconomics.org/apply/local-currencies-program/localcurrenciesdirectory/#map)
across the world.

As many blockchain-based experiments in money are working toward a
universal money, the infrastructure for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-currency.asp#:~:text=new%20currency%20units.-,Advantages%20of%20Digital%20Currencies,-The%20advantages%20of" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digitally native</a>
and composable money enabled by community computing protocols can also
help build confidence and capability for formation and maintenance of
more [locally sovereign financial
systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8EyOxAw75I).
While local currencies have often been considered siloed novelties, the
native composability of blockchains can help local currencies build more
direct connections to regional and global economies when helpful,
maturing their reach and usability.

With more capable tools for local money, municipalities have the
opportunity to lead a push away from [precarious international monetary
policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnYq3q3eb14), even
if they begin as [complementary
experiments](https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7513.html)
rather than [real
thrusts](https://www.mutualcredit.services/blog/complementary-economics-won-t-do-it)
for local monetary sovereignty.

### Obligation-Clearing and Mutual Credit

Understood most
[broadly](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/local-money-liquidity-saving/),
local currencies are attempts at building sustainable, locally coherent
financial systems without outside dependencies. A simple step in this
direction is
[obligation-clearing](https://www.mutualcredit.services/multilateral-obligation-set-off)
(credit offset), where economic relationships are mapped and account
balances between participating parties settle at the end of an
established term, often per month. The beauty of this system is that it
is not necessary to alter economic behavior in order to significantly
reduce necessary cash in a sufficiently-connected economic map. While
this may not occur to you as exciting, late invoice payments can
[meaningfully](https://tallystreet.com/2021/smbs-collect-more-than-half-of-their-money-late/)
disrupt the operations of small businesses.

> Participants mutually agree to allow a certain amount of value
> exchange to be settled using an accounting unit internal to the
> network... The network, through the aggregate commitments of all of
> its members, is effectively providing its own money supply.
>
> --- [Dil Green](https://twitter.com/dilgreen), <i><a href="https://www.mutualcredit.services/blog/someone-just-turned-the-lights-on#:~:text=The%20network%2C%20through%20the%20aggregate%20commitments%20of%20all%20of%20its%20members%2C%20is%20effectively%20providing%20its%20own%20money%20supply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Someone Just Turned the Lights On</a> </i>

[Mutual
credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_credit)
expands this concept and allows participants in such systems to extend
credit to each other beyond the period of settlement. Two such systems
in the real world today are the
[Sardex](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/sardex) system in
Sardinia and Switzerland's [WIR
Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIR_Bank). WIR Bank has
been operating since the Great Depression and
<a href="https://www.mutualcredit.services/mutual-credit#:~:text=ordinated%20way%2C%20and-,currently,-facilitates%20around%20a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently</a>
facilitates around a billion euros of trade per year without money
changing hands.

[One study
shows](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/13/12/295/htm) that
the Sardex mutual credit system reduces internal debt for the network
(and thus the need for cash) by approximately 25% when
obligation-clearing is used by itself and by 50% when it is used
alongside mutual credit.

Healthy mutual credit systems foster an economy necessarily embedded in
relationship, scaling and shifting within the limits of
[endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_money)
reciprocity, like a self-sufficient terrarium. They do not attempt to be
universally available money or a long-term store of value, but instead
serve the needs of users in a specific place and
[time](https://www.noemamag.com/what-if-money-expired/),
replacing the invisible
[negative](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33441183)
[externalities](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath)
inherent in today\'s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boom-and-bust-cycle.asp#:~:text=The%20boom%20and%20bust%20cycle%20is%20a%20key%20characteristic%20of,jobs%20and%20investors%20lose%20money." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boom and bust</a>
monetary systems with [positive
externalities](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1571569656036753408)
[present](https://twitter.com/informalinc/status/1600187514127409152)
in
[mutual relationship](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/mutualism-examples-of-species-that-work-together.html).

By reducing the need for individuals and local firms to carry and spend
outside money, these systems can be used to make local economic
relationships less dependent on
[fragile](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4387676)
banking systems and commercial banks, even while denominating their
value in a national currency.

### Distributing Monetary Sovereignty

While obligation-clearing is traditionally practiced only in informal
relationship between [friends and family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_(investment))
or formal arrangements among
[banks](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/173367/1/sdp2016-14.pdf),
new experiments on
[blockchains](https://cofi.informal.systems/FAQ) and other
<a href="https://creditcommons.net/#:~:text=ledger%20which%20they%20control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital ledgers</a>
are making such credit offset accessible to wider categories of
communities.

economic relationships on-chain can help communities understand the
shape of their existing economy, build more healthy economic loops, and
more quickly stand up mutual credit systems of their own. [Credit
Commons Society](https://creditcommonssociety.org/) is
working toward such a
[system](https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/nwQx4CqPAcwZ5zSNB2_K25N1quOF1NGcKaYcS3S33CA)
of interoperable sovereign money.

Historically, mutual credit systems have needed a trusted central
[operator](https://chamasoft.com/) to clear credit, but it
is possible these responsibilities can be delegated to autonomous and
transparent smart-contracts and managed through on-chain governance.
Overall, DAO structures may help with

of local currency, including visibility and management of who is able to
originate, accept and spend the currency.

The use of community computing architectures to engage in more
collective and localized sovereign control of monetary systems is more
than theoretical. [Community Inclusion

(CICs) like [Sarafu](https://sarafu.network/)

are real-world applications of highly-localized credit offset, giving
people a way to exchange goods and services and incubate projects and
businesses without relying on scarce national currency and volatile
markets. Many other dedicated organizations are working towards these
ends, including, [Circles](https://aboutcircles.com/) and [Mutual Credit
Services](https://www.mutualcredit.services/home).
[Cycles](https://cycles.money/) is a
blockchain-based system working to build [on-chain
infrastructure](https://twitter.com/cyclesmoney) to support
mutual credit systems to the benefit small communities.

## Where Does That Lead Us? 

Taken together, these budding tools for maturing modes of local
relatedness provide a pathway to balancing agency and limits over
generations, a
[dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_of_opposites)
equilibrium vital to the health of our neighborhoods, cities, and
society.

Instead of relying on the rigid imposition of extrinsic institutional
structures, equipped communities can self-regulate against patterns of
overconsumption and exploitation by rooting their economic and
organizational structures in empathy for one another and their home
places. The cultivation of these locally derived placemaking traditions
safeguards the vitality of our communities, not just in the present but
for generations to come.

How can we get there? Not by abandoning our homes to flee to
[new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(proposed_city))
[communities](https://twitter.com/alphaxbarry/status/1633176607031541761),
nor in the unlikely prospect of [healing our
institutions](https://twitter.com/jgcfyi/status/1503822879552688129)
from within. Instead, the answer lies in a long-term commitment to our
places and a willingness to engage with new tools to build a sustained
and vibrant community memory.
